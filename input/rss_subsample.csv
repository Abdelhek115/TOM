Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00	David Cameron Says Taking More Refugees Is 'Not The Answer' To Crisis	The EU's current migration crisis won't be solved by the UK taking in more refugees, David Cameron has declared.    Despite a growing clamour for Britain to do more to help those fleeing war and persecution in Syria, the Prime Minister stood firm to his position that the real 'answer' lay in tackling the root causes of the problem.    But his remarks came as Germany's ambassador to the UK today added to the pressure on London, urging all EU states to do more to help and making clear that Britain should take tens of thousands more refugees to reflect its size and population.    Mr Cameron said the Government were keeping under 'review' the numbers who could be let in, yet made clear he wanted other longer-term solutions.    "We have taken a number of genuine asylum seekers from Syrian refugee camps, we keep that under review, but we think the most important thing is to try to bring peace and stability to that part of the world.    "I don’t think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees."    The Prime Minister added: "We’re taking action right across the board. We’re helping the countries from which these people are coming, stabilising and trying to make sure there are worthwhile jobs and stronger economies there.    "We’re obviously taking action at Calais in terms of the Channel, which I’ve described on previous occasions. There’s more that we need to do and we’re working together with our European partners as well. These are big challenges but we will meet them."    The number of migrants entering Europe has soared this summer, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. But while Germany's refugee numbers have quadrupled, the UK has taken in just 200 Syrians.    Days after Angela Merkel made clear she was preparing to take in 800,000 refugees this year, Germany's ambassador Peter Ammon told the BBC's World at One programme that the strain was now obvious.    "Germany has taken in over the last months 43% of all asylum seekers that come to Europe," he said.    Asked if Mrs Merkel had Britain in her sights when she called for more burden-sharing, he replied: "She has everybody in her sights.     "This is a humanitarian challenge to Europe. Britain has been taking in refugees over centuries. And not to your disadvantage and I think we will expect that all partners will make the best efforts to contribute to a solution to this problem.    "Everybody knows how we feel about it, it is almost self-evident. Germany has taken in 43% of all refugees. We think that this number for Germany is too high, Germany represents around a quarter of the population, roughly a quarter of the European GDP if you take this as a yardstick. This gives you and idea how many Germany should take.  I will not tell you how many you should take."    "With the humanitarian tradition that we have and you have we should be able to find a solution. We have just seen the beginning of a humanitarian crisis, with waves of migration, which will probably shape global politics for decades to come. We have to find answers to this."    Mr Ammon agreed that longer-term diplomatic solutions in Syria and Libya and other countries were needed and stressed that he would not link the UK's conduct on refugees to Mr Cameron's bid for EU renegotiation.    mixed up    "I can't see that because some people mistakenly think these negotiaitons are of a bilater nature between Germany and the UK that's not the case. Of course.. there are expectations on Britain yes.    'surprised that the Austrians said this'.      'we want to make Europe better, it's not a tug-of-war.     #nothing to do with   	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Paul Waugh	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/02/david-cameron-says-taking_n_8076646.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

Fri, 28 Aug 2015 09:37:25	Beginning University And The Impact On Mental Health	The first year of university is always the most testing. You have to make new friends, navigate around a new city, and master a new pretentious language for your essays. From the moment you arrive at halls, you are immersed into a world of unfamiliarity.    Such transitions can have a huge impact on mental health, especially for those already suffering from anxiety and depression. According to Student Minds, a UK student mental health charity, "even those who have been recently discharged from specialist inpatient or day-patient services may spend their first months at university with no access to specialist support."     Research conducted by the organisation also revealed 96% of professionals feel students do not get specialist care as quickly as they would like – the average wait for an appointment with a specialist service being five months.    Amy Zile, a member of Student Minds' advisory committee, says: "So many people fall through the gaps in service provision and communication when moving to university. I have a summer birthday, so I turned 18 at the same time as I moved to university.     "The already stressful transition to university and trying to adjust to it with mental health difficulties was exacerbated by absolutely no guidance for me on where to find help at university, no talk about continuation of care - after using mental health services for years I was just left to look after myself, despite the fact every aspect of my life was changing."    Considering the isolation which many students face at some point during first year, the lack of adequate care is disappointing. For those on courses with low contact hours – many humanities students are in lectures, seminars, and tutorials for as little as five hours a week – such loneliness is built into their timetable.    Adapting to independent, research-led learning is made especially difficult as an immediate follow up to years spent in secondary education. In micro-managing students to pass exams and tuck their shirts in, schools and colleges fail to prepare pupils for the antithesis; learning which is grounded in individual spark and academic autonomy rather than box-ticking and assessment objectives. This is why students who have been educated privately - at schools where there is a culture of mollycoddling - tend to perform worse than their state school counterparts at university.    Andrea, now a postgraduate at the University of Edinburgh, suggests after "adjusting to the unstructured style of education", the hardest part of first year is “getting comfortable with a group of friends".     "There’s so much propaganda that the people you meet in halls would be ‘your friends for life’, and sometimes that was the case. But getting randomly placed with people isn’t the best way to ensure that."    The pressure to find a clique of friends as soon as you move into your accommodation is a common complaint amongst students. Nick, an undergraduate at Southampton University, says: “I found the tension awful. No familiar faces wasn’t something I had ever dealt with before, and I found it far too easy to just hide away in halls."    Unrealistic expectations of university also don’t help. Some students slog their way through UCAS with dreams of Oxbridge quads and midnight discussions of Sartre, others fantasise about Animal House frat parties, a tightly-bound pack of mates, and an endless stream of tequila. However you imagine university, the belief that your time there will be "the best years of your life" can only add to the self-consciousness of the experience.        A report published by the NUS in 2013 revealed one in five students consider themselves to have a mental health problem, with more than 25% not telling anyone about how they feel. Though talking about mental health is not as taboo as it once was, clearly there are still many students who feel uncomfortable discussing these issues with friends and family, let alone with professional counselors.      Marc Shilling, who also sits on the Student Minds Advisory Committee, believes that systematic changes in the way universities tackle mental illness are vital:    "All universities should have the same pastoral/mental health coordinators in place for when a student arrives. From our first meeting [The Student Minds Advisory Committee] it was clear that each uni varies in regards to support. There should definitely be a focus on mental health support around the start of uni and at exam times, maybe in the form of a lecture promoting support that is available (student minds peer support, medical centers etc). [...] It's obvious to say that the commissioners should put more money in to having staff available to support students, as a first instance."    As mental health services shut down due to spending cuts, it seems there are increasingly fewer places for students to turn to when they need help.     The best advice for freshers then would be to seek out whatever services their universities offer, but also to have honest conversations with flatmates, tutors, and course mates about mental health.

Fri, 28 Aug 2015 10:50:33	An Immigrant Story	Warning: This article contains the 'I' [immigrant] word.     On Thursday 27 August, whilst a summit focusing on the European migrant crisis took place in Vienna, twenty to fifty corpses were found in an abandoned lorry near the Austrian-Hungarian border. The bodies were apparently already decomposing when discovered, suggesting that the migrants had long given up their struggle for survival.     It goes without saying that these deaths did not occur in a vacuum, but are part of a mounting human toll who pay the ultimate 'cost of living'. It's not that these migrants died silently or invisibly, it's that a choice was made to neither see nor hear their plight. It is simply easier to continue laying barbed wire and fortifying European borders while allowing the Mediterranean Sea to become a graveyard - a literal manifestation of the saying 'out of sight, out of mind'. The same can be said for the UK, the island nation that imagines itself fighting an oncoming armada except the reality is much closer to an ark seeking refuge. The fear of 'the other' then allows the immigrant story to be re-written and re-presented as a nightmare; the immigrant seeking safety becomes the belligerent of a society under siege.     From the safety of suburban England, one can easily make a choice to avoid imagining what an immigrant story really is. Instead, the 'I' word becomes one that is feared, the 'I' word steals jobs and welfare benefits that are destined for British citizens, and the 'I' word can categorically never be one of 'us'.  Despite the UK lagging far behind Germany, France and even Sweden in terms of asylum applications, the 'other-ing' narrative remains the leading cause of fear-mongering and witch-hunting in the media.      The representations of immigrants being 'the "swarm" on our streets' (the Daily Mail, of course) is not only cold and grotesque, but it's all too reminiscent of the explicit anti-Semitic hostility shown towards Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution as recently as the 1930s. These European Jews were demonised for attempting to escape rampant persecution, just as today's Syrian refugees are tried for fleeing brutal regimes. Here I offer a brief example of a 'typical' immigrant story, and how the experience of persecution and suffering inspired a steadfast struggle for success fulfilled either by the immigrant herself or by her descendants.       Dora Kasstan was a Russian refugee entangled in the Nazi occupation of France and the French complicity in the Shoah. Like thousands of other 'foreign Jews' in Paris, she was rounded up in the dawn raids exercised by the French police in the summer of 1942. She was confined en masse in the Vel d'Hiv where she faced unimaginable sanitation facilities and was allowed meagre crusts of food, and drops of water. From there she was 'deported' to Auschwitz-Birkenau where her life was reduced to dust - for no other reason than being a 'refugee,' an 'immigrant,' a 'foreign Jew'. But her story did not end there. It continues with this article: as her great-grandson, a British citizen, a PhD candidate at Durham University and a writer, my 'success' is part of the struggle that defines an immigrant story. And there are an infinite number of narratives like it, if one chooses to listen.      It seems that the boundaries between oneself and 'the other' are not merely constructed between nations, but rather the frontier lines can be drawn within the social body. As I walked home from my office this evening, I passed two neighbours; one was washing his car and the other was pruning her front garden, but neither stopped to raise their heads and greet me or even look at me. I was neither moving silently nor was I invisible; rather they made a choice to turn their heads away and avoid acknowledging my existence. For me, the moment epitomised how 'an Englishman's castle is his home' - and, just as is happening in Europe, the implication that 'home' ought to be defended at all costs - even if it means stripping away an individual's humanity.    The fear-mongering surrounding the 'immigration' issue or 'refugee crisis' does just that - it strips people of their humanity. But it is important to remember that immigration is not only an investment for the future of the UK, it is also an integral part of its history. What we fear in an immigrant story is therefore what we fear within ourselves. Or perhaps it is not so much that we fear 'the other', but that we are afraid of seeing our own histories of persecution reflected in our actions. With this in mind, let us move away from our defensive attitudes and consider lowering the drawbridges and stepping out of the castle. We might be surprised that there is less to fear than we are led to believe.

Mourners say each had bright futures ahead, both professionally and in their private lives, and hope that scholarship funds set up in their memories will at least allow their dreams to live on through others.    Patrick Henry Community College, from which Parker graduated in 2009, announced it had set up The Alison Bailey Parker Memorial Scholarship in wake of the tragedy.      Christopher Parker, executive director of the PHCC Foundation, praised Parker (no relation) as "a great example of what dedication and motivation can do in someone’s life. [...] She made us all proud of her achievements and the way she carried herself through that success.”        James Madison University, where Parker graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree, will also be awarding a scholarship fund in the reporter's honour - the Alison B. Parker '12 Memorial Fund. A statement released by the university said staff were "shocked and saddened by the news and circumstances of her death. Our thoughts are with her family, friends and colleagues."    Alison Parker started working at WDBJ7 as an intern in 2012. The success of her career was rapid with her colleagues describing her as a "rockstar".     Adam Ward, the cameraman who was shot dead whilst filming Parker on Wednesday morning, is to have his legacy marked by The Salem Educational Foundation and Alumni Association, who are currently in the process of establishing a scholarship fund in his name.     Ward graduated from Salem High School in 2007 before going on to study at Virginia Tech. After graduating from the college in 2011, he began as an intern in the sports department of WDBJ7 and soon started working for the station as a reporter, videographer, and production assistant.    Tommy McDonald, president of the SEFAA, said “Ward was one of my all-time favorites because he took such an interest in his students and players, and most importantly, he cared about you as a person. As a teenager, he would instill confidence in me and would always make me feel good about myself."    Find out more about the Alison B. Parker Memorial Fund at James Madison University here and learn more about how you can contribute to the scholarship set up in Parker's name at Patrick Henry Community College here.

Fri, 28 Aug 2015 13:12:21	A Ticking Time Bomb?	The evidence that children and young people in the UK are some of the unhappiest in the world continues to mount. In the last week, one charity has revealed we lag behind Algeria, Romania and Ethiopia in terms of well-being, and another has highlighted the mental anguish young girls face every day.    It doesn't need great powers of deduction to see that rising levels of distress among our young people is likely to translate into more adults who are struggling to cope in the future. Samaritans already answers 5m calls for help a year from adults.     I remember vividly the difficulties of being a young person - and know the real joy and emancipation of getting older. It makes me wonder why we seem to be incapable of creating a world that cherishes and nurtures all our children and young people.    It seems to me that children and young people's health and well-being is a matter of intergenerational justice that collectively we must address. Until then, Samaritans' formidable army of more than 21,000 volunteers will need to gear up to be there round the clock for future generations.    A question which also needs addressing is how do we build emotional resilience among young people which will stand them in good stead later in life and reduce the risk of them floundering as adults? The melancholic English poet Philip Larkin may have written that Man hands on misery to man/It deepens like a coastal shelf,  but as a nation we should be dedicated to letting people know where they can get help and find a way through their problems, rather than letting distress flow on from generation to generation.    Mental health, cyber bullying and future joblessness came out as major worries for young girls in the widely-reported Girlguiding Girls' Attitude Survey.  Parents, the survey found, worried about drugs, alcohol consumption, sex and unwanted pregnancy rather than their children's day-to -day coping strategies and mental well-being.    The larger survey for the Children's World project which looked at the lives of 53,000 children in 15 countries, found children in the UK cited the "exam factory" mentality in schools, bullying and friendship issues as reasons for their unhappiness.    Self harm was also flagged up as a serious problem among 11-21 year olds by three-quarters of the young women who took part in the Girlguiding survey.     It is positive that recurring issues are being publicly identified, but that can only take us so far - getting someone who is struggling to take the vital, and potentially life-saving, first step of reaching out for help is a big ask. Perhaps giving people the tools to understand their emotions, or at least helping them to recognise when they might need to approach a third party for help, is the way forward.    A change of emphasis in society is also needed if we are to stop this potential tidal wave of unhappiness in its tracks before it leads to greater problems in the coming generations.   The Children's Society, which was involved with the Children's World survey in the UK, has been calling for more counsellors in schools, and schools are certainly a good place to start when building better emotional health.     In recognition of these issues, Samaritans developed DEAL (Developing Emotional Awareness and Listening) which is delivered as part of Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education in secondary schools.    DEAL gets teenagers to examine and discuss emotional health, coping strategies, feelings and communication skills.     Negotiating difficult emotions is a steep learning curve for most of us, and we gradually learn that ups and downs are normal, but there are times and events in life that can overwhelm us, and at any stage, any one of us can need support.     Talking openly about feelings and looking at ways to get through difficult times such as changes in friendships, divorce, moving house, failing an important exam, losing a job or a friend or relative dying, these challenges are thrown up at every stage of life.    It's a conversation we all need to have, young and old, about how we can support people who need it most and how we can as a society, make it easier to talk about feelings and ask for help - and that it is a sign of strength, and not of weakness.

Fri, 28 Aug 2015 13:19:44	Stop Glamourising Cancer	This week marks three years since cancer entered our lives. Mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of August 2012, before getting the all clear in Easter 2013 and being declared terminal in February 2014.    This time in 2012, I was embarking on a gap year, one brother was about to start his A-Levels and the other was starting year eight. In 2013, we were on a family holiday in France, walking up lots of mountains, attempting to mountain bike down some others, and eating far too many baguettes afterwards. 2014 came, and Mum's condition went up and down a bit, but we still managed to get away for a few days and head to the Dales for some beautiful walks.    This weekend, we were going to spend the day as a family, on the coast or at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, but it ended up not being possible. Mum takes a while to wake up in the morning, so we wouldn't have been able to leave until 2/3pm. Then it turned out to be super windy, and Mum wasn't feeling the best she'd ever felt, and we couldn't think of anywhere accessible to go that wouldn't have a small hurricane nearby, so we ended up just staying in. We had a pleasant enough day (I baked enough to sink a small ship!), but it doesn't hide how dramatically different our lives are now compared to how they used to be.    I was feeling pretty rubbish on Sunday night - overtired, and becoming increasingly angry at the whole existence of cancer, so I figured I needed to try to make my frustration productive in some way. I typed 'terminal cancer' into a site a lot of young people use to rant, get inspiration, and generally support each other through anything and everything going on in life.     Up came pages and pages of GIFs, screenshots and quotes from The Fault in Our Stars, broken up with the occasional bit from My Sister's Keeper and Before I Die. Scattered amongst these snippets of carefully constructed Hollywood drama were the writings and cries for help from other young people who are attempting to come to terms with losing a loved one to this horrible, horrible disease, in real life.    It was then that something I've always thought on some level really hit me. I am absolutely sick of the glamourisation of cancer. The 'Hollywoodification' of terminal illness. The warm filter put on dying.    When people are trying to reach out for help, and the only experience their friends have of cancer is a watery-eyed, highly made-up Hazel-Grace (without any jaundice, oedema, peripheral neuropathy, bags under her eyes, weightloss, or anything else that might come with cancer - if it weren't for her oxygen tank, she'd look completely healthy), staring into the beautiful eyes of the 'it's a metaphor' Augustus Waters (who by the way, also has none of those symptoms) it's not helpful. How is anyone supposed to come to terms with what they're going through when this is the picture of cancer put before them?    I picked TFIOS out because it's pretty prominent at the moment, but there are hundreds of cancer stories out there. Cancer is an easy illness to work with when scriptwriting; most people have heard of it, giving people a bald head can easily symbolise it, and the stages of cancer can easily be made to mimic the traditional three act structure of Western storytelling.    I have nothing against John Green or any other writer who writes about cancer, either in books, in films, or via some other medium; I would just prefer it if people didn't treat the characters in these stories as if they were real people. I'd love it if people who wanted to know the realities of cancer read real accounts of living with cancer, either written by sufferers or those close to them, and if we could dispel these ideas that cancer is all bald heads, cake, trips abroad, and profound moments.     Ideally, cancer would disappear from all our lives forever, but sadly we don't live in an ideal world. I hope that by writing about our experience of cancer, I can help people to gain a better understanding of terminal illness, and how it affects those involved, without resorting to Hollywood's cotton-candy version of dying.

Farah came from behind to claim victory, chasing down Kenyan Caleb Ndiku to win by just over one second. He won the 10,000m in Beijing last week.  It is the third time he has won both races, having done so at the 2012 Olympics and 2013 world championships.    The 5,000m was a slow-burn victory for Farah who was content to run at the back of the pack as his team-mate Tom Farrell headed the group.      Mo Farah celebrates after winning the 5000m; he has now completed a rare triple double in winning both the 10,000m and 5,000m races    The race hit top-gear with 800m to go when Ndiku overtook Farah and made a dash for the finish line. The 22-year-old, who won the 5,000 Commonwealth Games title last year, established a two to three metre lead over Farah.    But that all changed as they rounded the last bend. Farah finished the race in 13.50.38. Ndiku was just over a second behind, completing the distance in 13:51.75.    Farah covered the last 800m of the race in 1.49, which was only four seconds slower than David Rudisha ran in winning the men’s 800m earlier in the week, The Guardian reported.

It's fairly important for a Republican presidential candidate to be a big Bible fan, so it was a huge deal when he seemingly zig-zagged around the question and wouldn't even say if he favoured the Old or the New Testament.    This all prompted Twitter users to imagine what it would be like if the self-absorbed presidential hopeful wrote his own Bible.    &quot;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?

Lizzie Jones sang ahead of rugby league's Challenge Cup final, three months after her partner collapsed just four minutes into a rugby league game for Keighley Cougars at London Skolars. He died later that evening in the Royal Free Hospital.      Lizzie Jones, the wife of late Welsh rugby player Danny Jones, received a standing ovation at Wembley Stadium after singing 'Abide With Me'    It was later discovered that the 29-year-old had an undetected hereditary heart condition.    Jones - who left twins Bobby and Phoebe, now aged eight months - played at Wembley for Wales in 2011.      Danny Jones, a former Welsh international and half-back for the Keighley Cougars, seen above being tackled by New Zealand's Kieran Foran during the Gillette Four Nations, died after suffering a cardiac arrest just four minutes into a match in May    His wife, who is a professional singer, took to the field and sang in front of 70,000 fans as pictures of herself, Jones and their children were displayed on the stadium's two big screens. She was then joined on the field by her twins to a standing ovation.

Sun, 30 Aug 2015 15:30:25	Where Is the Labour Party's Emerging Talent?	Alastair Campbell - Tony Blair's Director of Communications during his time as Prime Minster  - has said in a number of interviews that he is perturbed by the fact that he has been asked back to "help out" at every election since he gave up his full-time role in 2004.     He said the very same thing to me when I interviewed him for The Badger, the student newspaper at the University of Sussex. Indeed, the question has to be asked, why are the Labour party not pushing through their new tranche of strategic communicators to help out their young, emerging politicians?     Stop. Wait a minute. Did I say 'young emerging politicians'? Who might they be then? Surely not Jeremy Corbyn, he's been around on the Labour backbenches, rebelling against the party line, since the beginning of time itself.     Perhaps Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper then? Burnham is hardly emerging and some would question his talent. He has, after all, stood for the Labour leadership before and would have come last if Diane Abbott hadn't thrown her hat in the ring.     Cooper has been surprisingly quiet in this leadership election and has clearly been preoccupied with working hard in local constituencies around the country to try and nullify the rising threat of  Corbynmania. She will probably do much better than pollsters and pundits expect; just as the Tories did in May.     Liz Kendall just doesn't seem to have it, she seems to be always on the verge of tripping over her own words, as if she is perpetually being caught off guard.     So, going back to my original question, where is all of Labour's genuine young talent? Chuka Umunna was seen as the poster boy of the Blairites but has since shown - with his withdrawal from the leadership election - that he can't cope with the pressures of being a leadership candidate, let alone the actual leader.     There are some others, but they seem to be wary of ruining their political careers before they have started. They know that Labour will probably lose the next general election and possibly the one after, so they have steered well clear to ensure that they do not get tossed onto the scrapheap after electoral defeat.     Just look at William Hague and his time as Tory leader after John Major's disastrous election defeat in 1997. He was very talented, but Margaret Thatcher's shadow continued to loom large, and it prevented Hague from moving away from an ideology that - when compared to New Labour - seemed cruel and stale.     Consequently, he failed to refresh his party's image and he paid the price with a dire performance at the 2001 election. Speaking years later, David Mellor - a Conservative minister in the Thatcher and Major governments - said that Hague's time as Tory leader was "rather like opening a very good bottle of wine several years before it should be drunk".     That is why figures such as Dan Jarvis, Sadiq Kahn, Tristram Hunt and Chuka Umunna - after giving it proper thought - have steered clear of getting sucked into the leadership miasma.     They and others are waiting for calmer waters, perhaps after the next leader fails, in order to give them a better chance in 2025. For the many who don't like the Tories, yes that probably does mean another ten years of Conservatism.     However, put it this way, if Corbyn becomes Labour leader and gets ousted after a disastrous two years, at least then the introspection period will be over sooner. Then Labour will move back to policies that are actually capable of winning an election.

The video clip from Vine account Charlie Murphy shows a hand reaching into a shop trolley filled with toy rubber ducks, pressing one which makes a comical squeaking sound as a result.    So far, so normal.     But when the hand reaches into the trolley again and presses down on all the ducks, something deeply sinister occurs.       A scene from the 'Duck Army' Vine    The 'duck army' sound has got everyone talking online. Comedy website College Humour declares it "the most important thing on the internet" saying "There is no point in talking about anything else on the internet right now, since the Duck Vine exists."    Judge for yourself:        Reddit commenters could not contain their joy at the clip, with one saying "If I found this, I wouldn't be able to stop until someone stopped me".    Reddit was also the scene of debate over why the wail of many ducks appears to be lower in pitch than the sound of a single duck.    "My guess is that the pitch increases with the speed of the air," said Reddit user Thornsten. "When it's just one duck on top the rubber rebounds pretty quickly, pulling the air in pretty quickly. When most of the ducks are weighed down with other ducks, the ones below can't rebound as quick since they have to lift the weight of the rest of the ducks, so the air gets pulled in more slowly."    "Or maybe the guy that tunes the ducks isn't exactly a pefectionist," [sic] replied Shoziku.    And the only thing more frightening right now than the 'Duck Army' is the 'Duck Army' reversed:        SEE ALSO:  What It Would Be Like If Donald Trump Wrote The Bible  Jimmy Kimmel's Rude Interviewer Proves Technology is Terrible 	UK Comedy - The Huffington Post	Louise Ridley	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/08/31/duck-army-vine_n_8063950.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-comedy

The former middleweight, 49, says that it takes him up to an hour and a half to compose replies to fans on the social network, despite a limit of 140 characters.    He told the Sun: “For me, it’s like gymnastics for the brain. It is only 140 characters. I’m quite verbose so I say quite a bit, but on Twitter I have to condense it.    “I sometimes spend 90 minutes on one tweet. I really do. And I have no shame in that, because my whole life has been being correct.    “At times I have spent the entire day on Twitter. It’s interacting with people. I love it.”    And rather than delegate the task of tweeting to his staff, Eubank says that he responds directly to all his fans.    “Imagine you were a Muhammed Ali fan or a Mayweather fan, and you’re actually talking to them and they’re responding to you," he told the paper, "How cool is that? That’s awesome. That’s ridiculous!    “My childhood hero is Bob Marley. Imagine you’re tweeting and he’s tweeting you back. Now that is some different type of awesome.”    Eubank has been the subject of a long-running meme on the Internet following an aside by comedy character Alan Partridge, played by Steve Coogan.    In a classic Partridge scene, the Radio Norwich DJ is desperately pitching ideas to a big-shot television producer. As part of his brainstorm, Partridge quips: "Erm, Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank..." And the meme was born.

In bizarre scenes, the water supply to the pitch turned on during play, showering players with water. See the video above.    The match was a "test event" for the venue, and a "worthy warm up fixture" for Barbarians and Samoa, according to the Olympic Park's website .    It sold the event as the first chance "to see the refurbished Stadium lit up for a rugby match ahead of the Rugby World Cup".    But in further embarrassment to the flagship venue, problems with the Wi-Fi connection and visibility from certain seats led fans to take to Twitter to complain.    With seats roughly 840 metres away from pitch I'd advise all West Ham fans to bring binoculars to Olympic Stadium.

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 09:11:46	Statistics and Headlines of the Rugby Variety - Rugby World Cup	In under twenty days the Rugby World Cup will be upon us and for rugby fans across the country Christmas will come early. When the announcement was made back in July 2009 that England had won their bid to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup the tournament seemed a lifetime away, however now it is a matter of days away and everything is in place to make it a tremendous success.     Over the past few months we have all been engrossed in the warm-up fixtures that have been happening across the globe and more recently the 31 man squad announcements and boy has this given us a lot to talk about. Now, with such a short time to go, it seems only right to review some of the headlines that have been created and to cast our eyes over a few of the tournament's statistics and records.    Mauro Bergamasco will play in his fifth Rugby World Cup after running out for Italy in the very first professional tournament in 1998. It is astonishing to think of the amount of individuals that have come and gone during that time and when he takes to the field for the first time during this tournament it will be a special moment. Italy's weekend clash with Scotland didn't go to plan for the Azzuri and with Wales next in Cardiff it may be a bumpy road into the tournament for Jacques Brunel's side.     Waisake Naholo may well make the most remarkable injury recovery in history in order to play a part for New Zealand. As with any pre-tournament injury the hearts of the world went out to Waisake when it was announced that he had cracked his fibula on his debut against Argentina.  However after having a 'herbal treatment' in Fiji he was today included as part of Steve Hansen's 31 man squad and looks likely to take part in the 2015 tournament. I wonder if the individual that administered this treatment is now part of Team All Blacks and will be on the plane to London in a few days time!?!     Last weekend, George North, earned his 50th Cap for Wales and became the youngest player ever to do so. George was just 22 years and 320 days old when he ran out at the Aviva Stadium and in doing so eclipsed some extremely well known names on the 'youngest list' including Jonny Wilkinson, Sergio Parisse and Morgan Parra.     In terms of the tournament statistics as you would expect England's Jonny Wilkinson leads the way when it comes to points scored with 277 in total. Indeed Jonny has scored 40 more than his nearest rival in the points table; Gavin Hastings who has 227 to his name. Wilkinson's 277 breakdown into one try, 28 conversions, 58 penalties and 14 drop goals of which we all know the most famous one!     From a tries scored perspective the great Jonah Lomu leads the way with 15 followed by two other Kiwis; Doug Howlett, 13, and Joe Rokocoko, 11. Rory Underwood is the top English try scorer also with 11 and two individuals that will take part in this tournament, Bryan Habana and Drew Mitchell, both have 10 and if they don't increase that tally in a few weeks time then something will have gone very wrong!!    Shifting the focus solely to the hosts; England have scored 1246 points in their Rugby World Cup history and have played 40 matches in total. Josh Lewsey's five tries against Uruguay in November 2003 represent the record scored by an English individual in one fixture and that game's result, 111 - 13, was England's greatest ever match winning margin. Paul Grayson scored a staggering 36 points against Tonga in 1999, a game that I actually went on a school trip to see (!) and Jonny Wilkinson's three drop goals against France in 2003 remain the most an Englishman has scored in one fixture.     The Rugby World Cup is the pinnacle of our sport, it always delivers hugely competitive clashes and history tells us that we will also witness an upset or two during the course of its eight weeks! 2.2million tickets have been sold and the tournament is expected to deliver a staggering £2.2billion of output into the economy. After 43 days of action the Rugby World Cup Final will kick off at 4pm on 31 October and after eighty minutes one nation will claim the William Webb Ellis Trophy and unashamedly I very much hope that it is England!

And I've dyed my hair garish pink for nearly a decade despite stressing that happiness comes from accepting who you are.     Sound like a contradiction? It's certainly the primary critique hurled in my direction when people struggle to understand how I can work in showbiz but also educate on self-esteem.    To be fair, it's taken me a while to get my own head around the secrets of a sound mental health thanks to a two-decade long battle with self-harm and growing up with the confidence of an ant, but a little miracle arrived in the guise of the word 'resilience'.    To me, resilience is like a sheet of armour. It's the coat I wear that ricochets off trolls, smears adverts that bully me into feeling insecure so I invest in their product, ridicules designers who insist 'clothes hang better on thin people', silences snide remarks from those I simply don't gel with or erases a stranger that belittles me from memory.    It's the rhino skin that helps me adapt to any situation; whether family, work, or social. It's the gift which makes me see three sides to every argument; their version, my version, the truth. It's the strength to know I am good enough. The humility to know I'm not always right. The tenacity to get off my arse and try again. The spirit to be pleased when others do well.     It's the act of not being sucked into things that won't matter in five years. It's rejecting the 'how dare they treat me like that' ethos for the 'I won't let them treat me like that' mindset. It's the insight that people say things in rage they don't necessarily mean.    It's the ability to question the world around us rather than soak things up like a sponge. It's owning insecurities, using them to grow from rather than hide behind. It's promoting what you love instead of bashing what you hate. It's choosing optimism. It's expecting the bullshit but never accepting it.     Resilience is like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it gets.         We cannot control those around us, nor the fate propelled into our path, but we can choose the attitude with how we then deal with what comes.    With resilience, the holy trinity of self-esteem, social media and a 24/7 world can co-exist.     Still, it is a skill that needs nurturing, and just as physical health is a work in progress (exercising and eating the right foods daily), so is mental health.     That is why The Self-Esteem Team, the group I work with who go into schools teaching students on mental health, self-esteem and exam stress, are writing to David Cameron every single day for the next year with our #letters2dave campaign until he agrees to meet us, in a bid to revolutionise the education system by including mental wellbeing on the curriculum.    Until that date is in the diary though, here are seven ways to build resilience:    1 Know this, every time you login to social media, it is 0.02% of reality. You are comparing your every day to everyone else's showreel. While that friend who posts kissing/yoga/anniversary pictures with the 'love of my life' may be nauseating, it doesn't mean their life is better than yours. It's just that arguing or crying into pillows don't make as cute snapshots. Besides, those who upload frequently are likely to lack self-esteem if they need constant validation from others. And always remember, your worth is more than the number of likes on your last selfie.    2 Don't waste energy on those who don't like you, their opinions won't pay your bills in future. It's not nice to know that haters gonna hate, but equally you'll be okay. Think about it, do you like everyone you meet? Create a tunnel vision to focus forward, cut them out your periphery, then just do your best and screw the rest.    3 In a world where the blame for low self-esteem is cyclical - is it the media bombarding us with stories of Kim Kardashian, is it the celebs sculpting their bodies with surgery to court headlines, is it advertisers who justify Photoshop with 'we're selling a fantasy' - what would happen if you turned the finger on yourself? For example, whenever the public click, share or comment on a Katie Hopkins article, it gives editors the green light that readers want more of this kind of story. Consider each link you click on like a vote, so if you don't approve, don't feed the monster by clicking.    4 Tricky as it can be, understand you may not always be right. In a world where beauty, money and fame are idolised, humility is massively underrated. Giving yourself permission to hold your hands up and admit mistakes (even if it's just to yourself, you don't need to shout about it) is crucial in growing as a person. This also applies to choosing wisely what you are offended by... and letting it go. Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. Besides, if someone insults you, judging you says more about them than it does about you.     5 Be prepared that bad days will come; it's part of being human. Whether it's hormonal, you're overtired, or someone says something to upset you, it's normal to have black days. Don't beat yourself up. What you can do is tweak your thought process to 'What can I do to make this better?' rather than 'This is so depressing.' Train yourself to think of solutions not problems.    6 Understand that mental health is not something only reserved for people with 'issues' while frothing at the mouth in a straitjacket. Anyone with a body and brain has a mental health (so everyone then). Treasure yours by challenging self-deprecating views. They say talking to yourself is the first sign of madness... but what if it was the first sign of sanity? Having a daily dialogue inside your mind allows you to take control and essentially tell negative/unwanted thinking to shut the hell up. Be your own cheerleader.     7 QUESTION QUESTION QUESTION. Rather than just absorb things thrown at you, ask yourself why, how, who does it benefit. Why are you being told by that advert that your hair is lifeless, or your skin needs tightening, or your tummy needs toning? Is it really going to make you happier, or them richer? Why did someone post near-nude pics on Instagram; to impress others, just because, or a cry for help? Why are your mates ganging up on you; because they're jealous, angry, or just not that good a friend? Why do you want to lose weight or bulk up; to be healthy, for a reaction, because you don't have the emotional vocabulary to express how you feel? The tools to question the world around you, to have the critical faculty to think for yourself, to brush off the thousands of conflicting messages thrown at us daily, is possibly the greatest gift you can ever equip yourself with.

With the eyes of the rugby world focused solely on this tournament it is time for them excel and deliver in the same manner that our International rugby sides want to do. Already in the build up we have seen a number of brands and teams' partners showing their hands from an activation perspective and I thought that it would be interesting to review and feature a few of these campaigns.     Of course those with full tournament rights, also known as Rugby World Cup Worldwide Partners; Heineken, LandRover, DHL, Societe General, Emirates and MasterCard have the most to play with. They are the only ones that are allowed to use the words Rugby World Cup and the Official tournament logo in their activity and alongside activating prior to the event they'll each play a role during the tournament. With a number of years in brand management I find it fascinating to see the different routes and avenues that these sponsors and others have taken. From their choice of insight to the creative images that they develop, each has their own unique style and there is little to no crossover in terms of their activation.     Brands that hit the nail on the head when it comes to sponsorship and activation are those that are able to make a seamless link between their product's usage and the event in question. A perfect example of this is LandRover and their takeover of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour. From the tournament organisers' perspective the Trophy Tour is there to engage individuals across the country with the forthcoming competition and to give them a chance to see the beautiful work of art that is the William Webb Ellis Trophy aka Bill. For LandRover they are able to showcase their own work of art through the bespoke LandRover Discovery that safely transports Bill around the country. The Discovery is a serious bit of kit and has featured in almost every press release and piece of AV and written content about the trophy tour.     Alongside this they have developed the #WeDealInReal campaign and have been delivering the messages to young rugby fans that have won the chance to be match mascots at the forthcoming tournament. The use of their rugby ambassadors to deliver these messages have created superb video content and their focus on grass roots with this part of their activation endears them to the public as well as making at difference at the heart of our sport. LandRover, as expected, have done a brilliant job to date and I expect that there will be more to come during the course of the tournament.     For Heineken their focal point is owning the pre-match coin toss as 48 fans will have the opportunity to flick the coin prior to every Rugby World Cup match including the Final. At first listen sponsoring the coin toss sounds a little cheesy however when you think about it this is actually cracking prize to be able to offer and something that is a little different. Heineken are no strangers to rugby having sponsored the RWC in 1995, 2003, 2007 and 2011 as well as putting it's name to the European competition from 1995 to 2014. Their articulated objective when it comes to rugby sponsorship is to 'provide creative and entertaining campaigns to leverage the sponsorship' and with a cast that includes Jonah Lomu, Scott Quinnell, Matt Dawson, Will Carling and John Smit they have a great blend of individuals to work with.      Another brand that is excelling is Canterbury, the official tournament kit supplier, as they are building on the success of their FanCam activity and going to town with it. FanCam was launched earlier in the season and personally I believe that this activation and lever is totally on the money. In today's society we all love watching other people do things, the popularity of reality TV shows us this and FanCam has enabled Canterbury to tap into this and showcase their products to millions without ramming them down people's throats. Now they are handing the reins to individuals in order to win the 'Ultimate Fan Cam' experience at one of the RWC matches with one individual even winning a place at the RWC Final. The fact fans will create videos to enter and then star in 'FanCams' at the tourament gives Canterbury a very large footprint to showcase themselves and a great amount of social media activity. Eyeballs are king and through user and brand generated content Canterbury have this one nailed!     It is interesting to see how brands are using this very large opportunity to showcase themselves and of course there are many more. From Lucozade to O2 to Duracell the nation's brands are going rugby crazy and why shouldn't they with the eyes of the world focused on England 2015?!

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 14:24:03	Is the Ukip Engine Running Out of Steam?	Since May, the buzz around the party that took close to four million votes but only one seat seems to have been fading away. In an article for The Telegraph explaining his reasons for staying on as leader, Nigel Farage wrote that "the fight starts here". However, considering the state of the party and recent polling, some are now left questioning whether 2015 was Ukip's peak. Is the Ukip engine running out of steam?    Unlike the other opposition parties, there has been no bragging of a membership boost following the election. Meanwhile, those that remain in the party, for which emails asking for donations have come in thick and fast, seem far less enthusiastic than prior to May. One of the best achievements for Farage's party in May was the gain of Thanet council, which is already appearing fractured and split. Last week, four Ukip councillors issued a statement branding council leader Chris Wells "a liability", arising from a row regarding a compulsory purchase order for Manston airport.    Back on a national level, the party has a suffered from far less coverage in the media since the election. Nigel Farage's campaign launch at the beginning of the month was given little attention until a major donor criticised Ukip for attempting to turn the 'No' campaign in to a "blatant Ukip front operation". Even when scandal hits, the headlines remain far away from Ukip. Last week, a Ukip candidate in a Welsh council by-election was dropped after suggesting that immigrants should be "gassed" - the story barely made the local evening news. Be it positive or poor, the party is receiving only a fraction of the attention and publicity it had prior to May.    Opinion polls have been far from promising for Ukip too. A national Comres poll published last week shown Ukip slip further to 9%, their worst share since February 2013. In a late June YouGov poll for next year's Welsh Assembly elections, Ukip remained firmly in fourth place for both the constituency and region polls. The party will be hoping for a much better result come next year's election, especially considering efforts earlier in the year to pose Wales as the party's "next target". Meanwhile, efforts to push the Brexit cause seems to have struggled to find momentum too - since the announcement of the referendum question, the best opinion poll result for Farage saw the 'no' campaign trailing by 7%, the worst was a 44% margin.    Council by-election results since May will cause even further concern for Farage. Since the general election, Ukip has contested 24 council seats that they have previously fought - in all but one, the party's share of the vote has fell. The worst result saw a 24% decrease of share in a Cornwall seat, in comparison to the last time the election was held in 2013. The only positive result saw an increase in Glasgow Craiton to 1.9%, in comparison to 0.9% in 2012.    The forecast is looking dim for Ukip. If the opinion polls and by-election results translate into a poor display during next May's Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament elections, it could be time for Farage's era at the helm to come to an end.

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 14:54:03	10 Dumbest Inventions Of All Time	  ©iStockphoto.com/Andrew Rich    The job of the innovator is rarely easy. But a few of these could have been easily avoided using the simple mantra: "If it's not broken, don't fix it".     1. The Marshall phone  The legendary guitar amplifier company which goes up to 11 has long had a line of personal headphones bearing their iconic logo. Recently they've gone one further with a Marshall phone. The key difference? Two headphone sockets so you can share you music with your roadie/girlfriend. Because of course, you do that all the time.       ©Marshall Press Office / Zound Industries Smartphones AB    2.Bic Lady's Pen  Ever worry that your writing implement isn't quite gender specific enough? Bic has your back. The For Her Medium Ball Point Pen is "Designed to fit comfortably in a woman's hand", while the "attractive barrel design is available in pink and purple".  Civilisation at last, and some of the funniest Amazon reviews of all time.    3. The hydrogen fuel cell charger  Weighing in at a pocket-busting 620g (the same as four iPhones), The UPP fuel cell is intended to be an easy way to top up your phone when it's out charge. But the economics don't quite add up, costing $140 up front and $40 for each additional cartridge. The DeLorean is not quite ready to head back to the future.     4. Kodak Advantix Preview  Having invented the digital camera themselves, Kodak spectacularly failed to capitalise on the invention which is now in everyone's pocket. Why? Because Kodak was a film business. And so they instead marketed the Advantix Preview. This camera took pictures simultaneously on film and digital so customers could chose which shots to print.    5. Internet Kettle  Ever wanted to turn your kettle on from another continent? No of course not. What about from upstairs? Well perhaps, but by the time you've got the app out and figured out how to use it, you're probably already in the kitchen. Water still needs to be inserted into the kettle in person.      ©Firebox      6. USB toasters  You know those times when you really fancy a piece of toast but you're not near a plug... but you do have some bread... and a charged laptop into which you can plug a USB toaster?     Oh yeah, there aren't any. Great novelty. Zero function. Now consigned to the garbage heap of history.    7. Clap operated switches  If you're too lazy to walk to the wall to turn your lights on or off, you might prefer light switches that respond to your every clap. Almost synonymous with the 60s the clap operated switch fell out of favour when slamming doors, errant cats and... well just about everything would create an instant inadvertent disco.    8. Internet connected scales  Tweet your every move, every cake, every bowel movement? Well you might as well broadcast your wildly oscillating weight as well. Yes, it might be motivational for the world's most narcissistic slimmers but it turns out that the rest of us would rather not shout about our extra pounds.      ©Withings Press Office    9. Google Glass  A good dose of common sense could have saved the search giant a little time and money here.     Wouldn't it be great to have you mobile phone overlaid on the real world so that you can never switch of and you can guarantee you'll freak out the people you're with?     Um. No. As soon as we had White men wearing Google Glass, it was fairly obvious the game was up.      ©FreeImages/Leszek Soltys    10. Apple Watch  Well OK, its not quite there yet, but we were one short on the list and smart watches in general are fast lining up to fill that slot. Having spent years telling us to abandon our watches for our phones, Samsung and Apple would like to make a swift about turn. The killer feature?

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 15:43:52	Police Cells Are No Place for the Vulnerable	Imagine you are suffering a crisis. You've been tipped over the edge and are so distressed that you are overwhelmed by thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Now imagine that, instead of being given appropriate NHS care and support, you are locked up in a police cell like a criminal.    This was exactly what happened to 161 young people in England and Wales last year, according to new figures. All were vulnerable individuals suffering with serious mental health conditions.    Mental illness is not a crime. So it is unacceptable that anyone - children or adults- should be put behind bars when suffering mental distress. And the police should not be the ones who pick up the pieces because the system cannot cope. Officers are spending too much of their time dealing with problems related to mental health. Mental health is a core police issue but officers are not health professionals. It should be the NHS which responds and provides an appropriate place of safety.       I recently chaired an independent commission on mental health and policing. What we found to our dismay was that too often it was the police who turned up when someone suffered a crisis and called the emergency services. That would never happen if it was a physical health crisis. There is no question that an ambulance would arrive and take you to hospital if you had a heart attack. So why should mental health be any different?    There have been welcome attempts at reform in the two years since the commission published its findings and the Crisis Care Concordat was published. Recommendations by the commission, such as street 'triage' schemes, where mental health nurses work alongside police officers, have provided nearly 10,000 people with emergency attention in just 12 months.     Innovative schemes like street triage are helping to reduce the number of people in custody with mental health problems. Other initiatives include putting mental health experts within police custody suites and courts. This is so they can identify early when someone has a mental health issue and needs support. In addition, the government has also announced an extra £15million next year to provide more places of safety for people detained under the Mental Health Act.    But the system still has flaws. It is inexcusable that patients face a shortage of acute mental health NHS beds. Indeed, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has warned that on some days there are no beds available full stop. There are deep-seated problems with services for children and teenagers. Waiting times for services are increasing and this is for beds which can be miles from home. Another issue is the lack of co-operation that can exist between the police and the NHS.      We also need to be vigilant that improvements made in one area are not undermined by changes in another. Mental health is a challenge for social policy and public services but the NHS is the frontline. So we cancel out any benefit if we fund police training on mental health only for the Department for Work and Pensions to introduce policies which impact on the benefits available for people with mental health issues.    Let us not forget as taxpayers that these issues over mental health impact on us all. They have profound social and economic consequences such as lost working days and other costs which amount to more than £100 billion a year. Change is needed urgently. NHS mental health services should be available 24/7 as they are for physical health problems. Crisis teams should be available to respond every day and at all hours of the day and night. We also need to end the stigma people with mental health issues often face when they dial 999 for help.     It is clear that we need more places where people can receive mental health treatment. This support does not necessarily have to be provided by hospitals. There are alternatives such as residential units in the community which can provide a place of safety and support.    We are not short of solutions- but we must act on them. Otherwise we will never end the travesty of young people held behind bars through no crime of their own.

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 16:13:41	The Public Are Telling Us Something - Labour Must Listen and Act if We Want to Win Back Their Trust	One of the many conversations I remember from the General Election campaign was on a doorstep in Swindon. It was with a father and son - two self-employed decorators covered in paint and plaster from a hard day's work. We had a long and difficult discussion.  "I used to vote for you lot," said the dad. "Not anymore".    We talked through their frustrations about a range of different issues: low pay, a lack of affordable housing, few decent apprenticeships - all issues Labour had policies on. But they simply didn't believe we were the answer.    After 15 minutes we both had to move on. They were voting Ukip.    Many Labour activists will have similar stories to tell from doorsteps across the country. Ukip may only have retained a single seat on 7 May, but they cost Labour many constituencies that we needed to win and contributed to our defeat in several communities we never expected to lose.    That's why Andy Burnham asked me to look into how Labour can reconnect with those who have left us for Ukip. Over recent weeks I've travelled to Ukip hotspots across the country and received hundreds of submissions from party supporters and members of the public to my consultation. I have now published my initial findings.    The rise in Ukip's support is effectively serving as a barometer for Labour's shortcomings. Our party has lost our connection with millions of people. Too many no longer trust us, are unsure about what Labour stands for and do not believe we are on their side.    There were three broad trends in how this damaged Labour's prospects across England and Wales.    First, Ukip challenged us in our traditional heartlands. Some 63 of the 100 seats where Ukip made their greatest inroads were Labour constituencies. In seats like Heywood & Middleton, Dagenham & Rainham and Hartlepool they won swings as great as 30%. This helped them achieve 44 second place results in Labour seats - including many we have represented for generations.    Second, Ukip blocked Labour from making progress in key marginal battlegrounds. There was a Ukip swing of 10% or greater in more than a third of the 106 key marginals Labour was targeting in order to form a government. Even small gains in particular wards were enough to make the difference in crucial contests like Croydon Central.    Third, UKIP entrenched Labour's southern discomfort and forced us into retreat in many communities we need to win back to form a majority government. In extreme cases they succeeded in pushing us into third place in constituencies that had Labour MPs as recently as 2010. In places like Basildon and Sittingbourne & Sheppey, Labour is in danger of becoming irrelevant.    Altogether, it shows why any idea that Ukip posed no threat to Labour or that they were a greater problem for the Conservatives was complacent and misguided. Nigel Farage has not only made good on his promise to park Ukip's tanks on Labour's lawn - he has driven them through the front door and crashed them into our living room.    There are no quick fixes or silver bullet solutions that will reconnect Labour with the people we have lost. We need to look at what story we want to tell, how we express our values through policy, and how we do our politics. These points are equally relevant to the important task of regaining the trust of swing voters who supported the Conservatives.    More than half of people surveyed do not think it is clear what Labour stands for - a view held by as many as three out every four Ukip voters. Labour needs to develop a positive narrative about who we are as a party, what we are about, and the kind of country we aspire to build.    We need to offer voters reassurance on issues like work and immigration. Otherwise we risk not winning a hearing for anything else we have to say. The same can be said of economic trust. The TUC's research has shown that Ukip supporters shared the same fears as other voters that Labour would spend too much.    Labour also needs to show how we will extend opportunity to parts of Britain that feel forgotten. This is especially relevant to the coastal communities that often provide a cocktail of the factors fuelling support for Ukip - including higher proportions of older and blue collar voters left behind by economic change.    And we need to tackle Ukip on the ground. We must revitalise our constituency parties and give Labour campaigners the capacity, confidence and flexibility to effectively respond to the issues on their doorsteps and rebuild trust at a local level.    Overall, I hope my findings will serve as a useful starting point for a wider debate across our movement about how we can overcome Ukip's pessimistic brand of politics and return Labour to government.    The public are telling us something. Our duty is not only to show that we are listening, but to act. If Labour cannot produce a vision for our country's future that is more attractive, credible and optimistic than that offered by Nigel Farage, then we won't defeat David Cameron or whoever comes after him.

Barack Obama is to appear alongside the British adventurer on a hike into the Alaskan wilderness for a TV programme to be broadcast later this year, NBC announced on Monday.     The show will focus on the environmental impact of climate change in the northern state, which is known for its freezing temperatures (minus 80F) and impenetrable icy terrain... and Sarah Palin.      The British adventurer is to show the president how to survive on Alaska's Exit Glacier in the Kenai Mountains    "President Obama will meet with Grylls while visiting Alaska to observe the effects of climate change on the area,” read a statement from the network. “The two will then come together in the Alaskan Wilderness. President Obama will become the first US president to receive a crash course in survival techniques from Bear Grylls. The visit will be taped and aired on NBC later this year."    The film is to be taped on Tuesday in Exit Glacier in Kenai Mountains, according to the New York Times. The trip could prove dangerous, with black and brown bears roaming the Alaskan coastline, though it's likely a heavily armed secret service detail will be in tow.     And no it shouldn't come to this! (I hope!) https://t.co/0RHdDZjg1i— Bear Grylls (@BearGrylls) August 31, 2015      On Monday, Obama set off for a three-day tour of Alaska to view for himself the consequences of warmer global temperatures. Following tough new regulations on carbon emissions, the president is bent on spending the last 16 months of his administration pushing for greater consensus on how to tackle climate change,     Speaking to Reuters, Sharon Burke, a former Pentagon official who worked on energy issues for Obama, said: "It's a really important punctuation mark on what he's saying is a top priority for him. It's the ultimate legacy issue because it is something that's going to affect so many generations of Americans."       US President Barack Obama rides a bike on August 22, 2015 in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard    Grylls, who once served with the SAS, is well known in the US for guiding a raft of hapless yet willing celebrities into unfriendly environments, forcing them to learn and rely on survival skills.     Called "Running Wild With Bear Grylls," Kate Winslet, Zac Efron and Channing Tatum have all appeared on the show. In a recent episode, "Fast and Furious" star Michelle Rodriguez was asked to eat a mouse stewed in her own urine. On Monday, a petition was launched demanding the Commander-in-Chief do likewise.

Mon, 31 Aug 2015 21:43:15	Vice News Journalists Jake Hanrahan And Philip Pendlebury Charged With 'Helping ISIS' In Turkey	A court in Turkey charged a pair of British journalists with "engaging in terror activity" for the Islamic State group on Monday. Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, who are employed by Vice News, were arrested while shooting a film in the predominately Kurdish region of Diyarbakir on Thursday. A Turkish colleague, who was working as a fixer, was also arrested. He has not been named.     The trio was filming violent clashes between local police and members of the pro-Kurdistan Workers’ Party last week when they were taken into custody. According to Reuters, they did not have government accreditation. On Monday Hanrahan and Pendlebury were charged with “assisting Islamic State” and will stand trial.      Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inspects a honor guard during a welcoming ceremony before a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci on July 20, 2015     In a statement, Kevin Sutcliffe, Vice head of news programming in Europe, responded by calling the charges “baseless.” He said: "Today the Turkish government has levelled baseless and alarmingly false charges of 'working on behalf of a terrorist organisation' against three Vice News reporters, in an attempt to intimidate and censor their coverage."     "Prior to being unjustly detained, these journalists were reporting and documenting the situation in the southeastern Turkish province of Diyarbakir," Sutcliffe added. "Vice News condemns in the strongest possible terms the Turkish government's attempts to silence our reporters who have been providing vital coverage from the region. We continue to work with all relevant authorities to expedite the safe release of our three colleagues and friends."

"This is yet another example of the Turkish authorities suppressing the reporting of stories that are embarrassing to them,” said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey Researcher.    He added: “They should release the journalists immediately. It is completely proper that journalists should cover this important story. The decision to detain the journalists was wrong, while the allegation of assisting Islamic State is unsubstantiated, outrageous and bizarre."    A Foreign Office spokesman said they are “providing consular assistance” and are in touch with the “relevant authorities.”    SEE ALSO:   Bear Grylls To Lead Barack Obama Into The Alaskan Wilderness  Shigir Idol Revealed To Be 11,000-Years-Old  Corbyn Attacked For Calling Death Of Bin Laden A 'Tragedy'    Refugees on the Syrian-Turkish border in June:    	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Paul Vale	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/08/31/vice-news-journalists-charged-turkey_n_8068372.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 03:10:33	Police Chiefs Warn 22,000 Jobs Could Be Lost Under Fresh Conservative Cuts	As many as 22,000 police jobs could be axed under fresh Government cuts, leaving the public protected by the lowest number of officers for over forty years, police chiefs have warned.    The figure set to face redundancy is much higher than previously known, and means the number of police officers in both England and Wales could fall to a combined total of under 100,000, The Guardian claimed.    The news comes after an estimated 17,000 officer jobs were eliminated by the Conservative-led coalition government between 2010-15.    Chief constables' fresh estimates revealed on Tuesday are based on just the lowest expected cut of 25% in funding from the government for policing over the next four and a half years. Currently, there are around 125,000 officers in England and Wales.    The estimate is not the only one circulating among senior officers. An alternative projection suggests the level of officer losses could be higher at 30,000 in the next five years across the 43 police forces in England and Wales.    After George Osborne's July Budget, the chancellor told government departments whose spending was not ringfenced, including the Home Office, which administers police forces' pay, would face cuts of anywhere between 25% and 40%.        An emergency so-called "gold group" has been formed by senior Home Office officials and high-ranking police chiefs to formulate their arguments and present them to the Treasury ahead of Osborne's decision about how much each department should cut.     One senior officer reportedly told the Guardian: “This time a greater part of the reduction will be borne by police officers.”     Last month there was controversy after one police force said it was only responding to burglaries reported by even-numbered houses, while Sara Thornton, the chair of a body representing police chiefs, went further to suggest an officer might not attend every breaking and entering incident.    Story continues below slideshow      Budget cuts faced between 2010 and 2015 were made by efficiency savings, selling police stations, and culled civilian staff.     Privately, police chiefs accept that under the previous Labour government they had been able to do without 12% of the budget and they had got used to during times of relative financial plenty. But they are now claiming that an era of cuts without impact on service to members of the public have long since vanished.    When the brunt of public-spending cuts first started in 2010 there were 143,734 full-time police officers- that figure has since diminished to 125,000.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 03:40:54	The Waugh Zone September 1, 2015	        The five things you need to know on Tuesday September 1, 2015...            1) ONLY MAKING PLANS WITH NIGEL    For quite a chunk of the population, today is football transfer deadline day. But on planet politics (and yes it’s nice to be back after the summer break), Nigel Farage is making clear that he’s a one-club man. Clearly in no mood to join any other team, the UKIP leader has decided he will front his own ‘No’ campaign rather than be seen sharing a platform with Tory and Labour Eurosceptics.     On one level this is politically sensible, and learns the brutal lesson of Labour’s problems in siding with the Tories in the Scottish independence referendum campaign. The ‘official’ No campaign will be relieved too that Farage is not seen as their frontman, given how ‘divisive’ he is (copyright Suzanne Evans). Douglas Carswell can continue links with the official campaign. But as in Scotland, Farage sees the bigger picture, believing that although he lost the battle of the general election (with just one MP to show for it), he can use his bridgehead to go on to win the bigger prize of Brexit.    Of course, all of the recent focus on the EU’s migrant crisis only strengthens his simple message that quitting the EU is the best way of protecting the UK’s borders and it looks like Farage will put immigration front and centre of his campaign. The danger is that he’s seen as not just a one-club man but a one-club golfer, with immigration his only policy concern. Yet I suspect that’s a price he’s happy to pay in the run-up to 2020. Even if he loses the referendum, he’s poised to feed on Tory splits and a politics of resentment that could follow a vote.    Farage was on the Today prog setting out how his themes for his Friday launch (‘I’m not refusing to work with anybody’). The BBC says the Yes campaign is to get funding from former Labour minister Lord Sainsbury, cross-party personnel like Mandelson, Danny Alexander and Damian Green. And could be led by former Easyjet (and Guardian) CEO Carolyn McCall.        2) OPT-IN OPTICS    The FT splash looks ahead to the end of the week when the PM jets out for another charm offensive (preferably focusing on the former not the latter) in Spain and Portugal. The paper says that David Cameron has scrapped moves to get a full British opt-out of EU employment laws ahead of his renegotiation. In July, it was reported he was looking at a full opt-out but one member of his team now tells the FT ‘we aren’t trying to get the full opt-out back’. This could further inflame Euroscep backbench opinion but the PM seems happier to send out a message of ‘pragmatic’ moderate reform, while ensuring the TUC and Jeremy Corbyn don’t use any anti-worker moves as an excuse to back a No campaign. At the final Labour hustings, Corbyn told me he did not rule out joining the No campaign if Cameron traded away workers’ rights. Still, Cameron is determined to ensure the EU working time directive doesn’t harm the UK economy - how he gets such guarantees remains unclear, however.        3) MOVEABLE LABOUR    Yvette Cooper has a Big Speech this morning setting out her own plan to ease the EU migrant crisis. And several papers focus on Angela Merkel’s warning yesterday that Schengen border arrangements could be scrapped unless serious action is taken soon. Cooper says that Britain must take more of a role in the crisis, with help for asylum processing centres in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Spain, North Africa and Syrian refugee camps. She also wants more aid for states like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and more action against human trafficking gangs.     Nigel Farage on Today, again attacked the ‘stupidity’ of a common EU asylum system and talked of ‘an exodus of Biblical proportions’ - but said the UK could only offer to take in ‘a few thousand’ refugees from Syria’. He rammed home his wider point on economic migrants: that Romanian and Bulgarian migration to the UK had rocketed as much as UKIP had predicted. That’s still a problem for the Conservatives (and last week's figures were their biggest PR problem of the entire summer).    Last night, Andy Burnham repeated what many see as his main pitch: I’m as left wing as Corbyn, but I’m electable. Gordon Brown points out in the Radio Times that it was Keir Hardie who first said Labour had to ‘become electable’ if it was to make a difference to people’s lives.  Dan Jarvis blogs for HuffPost today on the outcome of his own review of why UKIP did so well on May 7 in many Labour areas.    The Times reports a Ukrainian human rights activist criticising Jeremy Corbyn for appearing to be pro-Putin.  But with Corbyn seen by many as the clear favourite, Patrick Wintour has a neat analysis in the Guardian pointing out the big hurdles his team faces if he wins. It suggests he could face a legal challenge (which will probably fail) if he doesn't win a majority among 'full' members and would be 'walking wounded'. The big question is how any Shadow Cabinet could work if it included MPs who didn't feel Corbyn was upto being PM.     There’s a Channel 4 News Labour leadership debate tonight. Don’t tell me you’re bored of it yet.        BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR...    Watch Kanye West declare ‘I’ve decided in 2020 to run for President’.  Sounded like a joke at Trump’s expense but a political action committee has already been set up by fans - and they want him to run as a Republican.          4) THE BARE MINIMUM    David Cameron has scented another chance to exploit what he sees as Labour vacating the political centre ground. His piece in the Times declares that bosses who fail to pay the National Living Wage could be banned from running a firm for 15 years. There will be a crackdown from a new ‘Labour Market Enforcement Director’. Together with his EU announcement, it’s perhaps his most TUC-friendly statement since becoming Tory leader. It’s all about moving from doing the bare minimum on enforcement to taking real action. Note that this is the issue the PM wants to be seen focusing on for his first day back after the August break.    But the political punch is obvious. Using the Labour leader race to tar all of the contenders with the Corbyn brush, he talks of its ‘anti-Nato, anti-American, profoundly-anti business’ approach. Oh, and he reclaims One Nation for his own party again, while saying the Tories are the ‘true party of working people’.  Andy Burnham has already hit back, repeating that he’d extend the minimum wage to all age groups and pay £11 nationally and £12 in London.        5) NOVA SCOTIA    Nicola Sturgeon has told the Beeb that she’s planning a ‘bold and ambitious’ programme as she sets out her Holyrood plans today. Moves to tackle domestic violence will be watched closely but it’s on bread and butter issues like education and health gaps between rich and poor where the SNP are most under fire from their opponents.     Labour’s leader Kezia Dugdale told Today she’d scrap school inspections (not quite the Tristram Hunt approach to the issue, one suspects), seizing on teacher union worries about the Scottish Government’s plans to standardise assessments. She ducked questions about whether a Corbyn-led Labour party would help it counter the SNP’s anti-austerity drive. But her firm line ‘The Scottish Labour Party is led by me’  and the repetition of her line that she was open to the renewal of Trident made clear she wasn’t exactly a Corbynite. Still, she did praise him for saying how he’d spend the nuclear savings on jobs.            ONES TO WATCH    The Daily Mail splashes on the appalling case of former Army Colonel Samual Rae, a dementia sufferer whose personal information was passed on by charities. The Information Commissioner’s Office has vowed an immediate probe. Ministers like Chris Grayling may have more to say.    Speaking of personal data, the Guardian also highlights new emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server. One email from David Miliband lays bare his heartache at losing to Ed in the 2010 leadership race, with him saying it was ‘doubly’ ‘tough’ because he’d won the backing of party members and MPs. He also added ‘When it’s your brother...’    Lots of papers pick up the excellent FoI from Pulse magazine revealing that £120m in personal health budgets in one area included spending on things like a summer house and pedalo rides. Liz Kendall is an evangelist for PHBs, but surely her opponents won’t seize on this for political capital...will they?    As the second term of austerty begins to bite and Whitehall departments jockey ahead of the spending review, expect to see more ‘cuts’ stories not fewer. The Guardian splashes on private estimates circulated among police chiefs that 22,000 police jobs will be cut. the LGA also warns more cuts are really biting the bone not the fat or flesh any more.

Re-Live The ‘X Factor' Audition Everyone Is Talking About  Olly Murs Devastated Over Pal's 'Uncomfortable' 'X Factor' Audition    The claims emerged after the group’s first audition aired on the ITV talent show on Saturday (29 August), when footage of them on ‘SuperstarK6’ under the name MICA, came to light.    Story continues below their audition video...         Fourth Power    Together, they made it through to the final 10 of the show, and even ­released records available to buy on Amazon under the names of The Gollayan Sisters and The Cercado.    It was reported that producers knew about their professional past and approached them to fly over from the Far East to audition.     However, an ‘X Factor’ spokesperson has now denied those claims, telling ‘The Mirror’: "’X Factor’ producers did not approach Fourth Power to audition - they flew to the UK to audition of their own accord and went through exactly the same audition process as other acts.    "Their interview in the programme clearly said that they had been performing together since 2001 and had competed in various places.    "There are no rules preventing anyone who has appeared on other shows from applying for ‘The X Factor’."        The group - made up of four sisters, Almira, Celena, Mylene and Irene - proved a hit with judges Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora with their rendition of Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj’s hit ‘Bang Bang’, and their audition has already clocked up over three million views on YouTube.

The family were forced to leave the show back in December 2014, when it was announced that Andrew would be running as a Ukip candidate in the general election, contesting the East Sussex seat, Hastings and Rye.       The Michael family    Speaking when the family were axed, a Channel 4 spokesperson explained: “Sadly any cast member becoming a party candidate will have to step down from involvement in ‘Gogglebox’.    “The Michaels have been excellent contributors and we are very grateful.”    The Michael family are the first group to ever return to the show after being edited out.     The Gilbeys weren’t so lucky when son George signed up for ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ last year, as they were dropped for good following his move.     ‘Gogglebox’ will return to Channel 4 on Friday 11 September, and bosses are also planning a special episode, featuring children who love TV, which will air this Christmas.

The US supermodel flew off the handle when hot water in the reality TV house ran out, angry that James Hill, Jenna Jameson, Farrah Abraham and Austin had spent over an hour in the tub.      Janice Dickinson    "I wanted a f*****g bath ok selfish people…it’s called common f***ing decency," she raged.     After Janice then attacked Gail Porter for wanting to clean the bath, Austin raged: "Who unpacked your f**king bags, she spent the whole day unpacking seven of your bags... no hold on a second. She spent hours unpacking your stuff, giving you a tour of the house... she has done everything for you."    Janice later made a spitting gesture towards Austin, but has denied she actually spat at the US reality star.     After being called to the Dairy Room, Janice told Big Brother: "In the garden the fight was escalated... He started to follow me. I did not spit on him. I made the motion that I spat on him."      Austin Armacost    She was then called to the Diary Room later in the day, where she was given a formal warning for her "aggressive" and "unacceptable" behaviour, and told that it was the first and last warning she would have.     However, long-term fans of the show questioned why she wasn’t removed, as ‘Big Brother 9’ housemate Dennis McHugh was ejected for spitting at Mohamed Mohamed in 2008 during a fight.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 04:23:52	Student Bekah Miles Gets Hidden Message 'I'm Fine Save Me' Tattoo To Force Herself To Talk About Her Depression	A 21-year-old student's tattoo which contains a hidden message has sparked a worldwide discussion around depression after she posted a picture of the body art on Facebook.    Bekah Miles, from the US, says she got the tattoo to force herself to open up about her mental health struggles. The leg tattoo reads "I'm fine" to anyone who sees the writing, but says "Save me" when Miles looks down at it. The student posted pictures of her leg on Facebook, which have been shared more than 320,000 times since 24 August.    (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));(Dear mom and dad, please don’t kill me over this permanent choice. I want you to hear me out.)Today, I am coming out...Posted by Bekah Miles on Sunday, 23 August 2015    In the post, which was an open letter to her parents, Miles thanked everyone who had helped her in the battle, saying "I would not be where I am without you".    The Facebook post, which also included a quote from Robin Williams, said: "(Dear mom and dad, please don’t kill me over this permanent choice. I want you to hear me out.)    "Today, I am coming out with something that only few of you know. I am ready to have a conversation about my mental illness.    "Last year, I was diagnosed with depression. And in all honesty, I believe it was a problem for quite a while before that, but I think it just got worse to the point of hardly functioning.    "So today, I got this tattoo. I feel that my leg was the best place for the meaning behind it. When everyone else sees it, they see “I’m fine,” but from my viewpoint, it reads “save me.” To me, it means that others see this person that seems okay, but, in reality, is not okay at all. It reminds me that people who may appear happy, may be at battle with themselves."    Miles goes on to describe how depression affects her daily life, adding: "This is one of the most difficult things to open up about because it’s extremely hard for me to feel vulnerable…but this needs to be talked about. Mental illness is serious, but so shamed in our society. We care so much for our physical health, but hardly a thing about our mental state. And that is seriously messed up. Mental illness is not a choice and will likely hit everyone at some point in their life. If it’s such a huge issue, why aren’t we having this conversation about it?    "That’s why I got this tattoo; they are great conversation starters. This forces me to talk about my own struggle, and why the awareness of it is important. You’d be surprised by how many people YOU know that struggle with depression, anxiety, or other mental illness. I may only be one person, but one can save another...and that's all I could really ask for.    "Maybe this is part of why I am so interested in psychology. I want to help people who feel the way I have—and still do—because it’s hell. And I don’t wish that upon anyone."

The impressive three minute cinematic shows lead character Spartan Locke and fan-favourite in the form of Nathan Fillion's Buck along with a team of fellow super-soldiers take on what looks to be an entire army as they go behind enemy lines.    Reminiscent of the 'Avengers' films it's clear that new developers 343 Industries are keen to show off the full breadth of the team that you'll be a part of, wiping clean the illusion that this would be a Master Chief-only storyline.    While plot details are relatively sparse we do know that both Buck and Spartan Locke will be part of a team that are hunting the lead character for reasons unknown.        The game will be launching exclusively on Xbox One along with the promise of next-gen graphics, ultra-smooth 60fps gameplay and multiplayer that'll bring back the nostalgia of the original titles.

Halo 5 Guardians will be available on 27 October.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 04:48:11	Have We Hit Communication Overload?	Last weekend I was at a party. After a rather long but fantastic night, on the Sunday morning, two young guests discovered they'd lost their phones. No problem, I said, just activate 'Find My iPhone' and check its location on the web app. Strangely they'd never even heard of it. I helped them to turn it on and we ended up finding both of the phones: one in the back of a taxi, and the other...in a field.    This incident confirms at least two of my suspicious. First, judging by the location of the phones, young people of this generation are much the same as young people of every other generation. Secondly, and more interestingly, they've started to switch off when it comes to technology. They have so much tech at their fingertips, they're starting to lose touch with what is possible - and hence what it offers them. It seems we are entering a critical period of information overload.    There is so much technological noise out there right now; so many apps; so many upgrades; so many content providers; so many packages, bundles and choices. In this new world, where we have so many technological options, it's easy to find our eyes glazing over. We have reached 'peak technology'. That's not to say that young people are less interested in tech, it's just that there's so much out there, it's difficult for them find what they want, when they want.    Look at the facts: There are 1.5 million apps in the iTunes store and another 1.6 million in Google Play. Even if you discount the doubling up, that's more apps than any one person would even consider downloading in a lifetime. In this new world, people aren't able to quickly and easily find what they want.    Just as it makes it difficult for consumers to hear what's new or really important, it also makes it hard for businesses who develop apps and communications services to get their voices heard. In fact, recent research done in July 2014 by mobile analytics company Adjust, found that 80 per cent of apps are 'dead' or 'zombies' - hardly anyone ever downloads them, presumably because life is just too short. I'm sure there are lots of good apps with the potential to become the 'next big thing' in there, but they have become 'lost' among all the noise.    App developers and tech providers need to take all this information on board - and react positively. Developers need to find new ways to cut through this hubbub, and this doesn't mean simply investing in marketing. It means designing and developing apps in such a way that they are sticky - and that they 'entangle' users, to use a turn of phrase that's very popular at the moment. We also need to make sure that when a user downloads our apps or signs up for our services, we really do capture them for the long term.     How do you do that? From my experience, one of the best ways is to create your own app ecosystem. Of course, this is not achievable for all developers. But if you're creating a series of apps and digital services, you need to make sure that they work together and supplement each other. They should amplify each other, rather than cancel each other out. If possible, they should encourage users to download or adopt your other services too. Apple, for example, has done this very successfully. It has leveraged its dedicated computer and smartphone customers, to encourage them to adopt their other services, such as iTunes, iCloud, and iBooks. Samsung hasn't done this quite so well.    Of course, the 'technology overload' has not been all-bad for business. With every threat comes an opportunity, and this scenario is no different. The explosion of apps and digital services has terminally eroded brand loyalty. Younger people are very happy to leap from platform to platform quickly and frequently. In the space of just a decade young people in the UK have moved from MySpace to Bebo, from Facebook to Twitter, and now on to Instagram to Snapchat. Internet users are now more happy than ever to try new apps and services, perhaps because of how easy it is to download something new - and get rid of it. In spite of how competitive the sector is, there is now more space than ever before for new companies to quickly grab a lion's share of the app market.    Combining these two lessons can teach emerging technology firms something very important: success can be fleeting unless you have a solid plan in place to retain your users - not only in the medium term but in the long term too. Tech companies can see their users disappear effectively overnight. If you are lucky enough to have a taste of early success, build out your apps and services so they 'entangle' users in a platform of your services.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 05:14:42	Idris Elba Is 'Too Rough' To Play James Bond Claims New 007 Author Anthony Horowitz	The author of the next James Bond novel has declared he does not think Idris Elba is the right actor for the part – though he insists “it’s not a colour issue.”     Anthony Horowitz’s novel Trigger Mortis is the latest novel to join the 007 franchise.      But while Horowitz is passionate about Daniel Craig in the role of the amorous spy ['... Craig is a terrific Bond'], he is less enthused about bookies’ favourite Elba to replace him.       Idris Elba    In comments reported by the Mail Online, Horowitz said: “Idris Elba is a terrific actor, but I can think of other black actors who would do it better,” [Horowitz names Adrian Lester, star of Hustle as his preferred choice.]    He adds: “For me Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part. It’s not a colour issue. I think he is probably a bit too ‘street’ for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah.”     Elba for his part, has made no secret of his desire to play Bond, though earlier this year the 42-year-old lamented he no longer believed it was a possibility.       Anthony Horowitz is the author of Trigger Mortis     In April he told a crowd at the British Film Institute in London: “If there was ever a chance of me getting Bond, it’s gone.    “Daniel Craig actually set the rumour off. About four years ago he said Idris Elba would be a great Bond and it started to creep. I blame Daniel.”     In the past, Idris has made no secret of his desire to play the spy, telling Reddit users during an AMA in September: “Yes [I would play James Bond], if it was offered to me, absolutely.      Daniel Craig is currently filling the shoes of James Bond     Even though he now thinks he’ll never play the part, Idris hit back at claims he is not British enough for the role.    “I was born here. I was born in England, born and raised,” he says.    When it was suggested that he was more British than Bond himself, who has been played by Irishman Pierce Brosnan and Australian George Lazenby in the past, Idris replied: “You could say that.”    Brosnan has already given Idris his personal seal of approval to take over the role.    When quizzed by Radio Times about whether he thought Idris would make a good Bond, he said: “Yeah, he would actually. Colin Salmon also.    “May the best man get the job and may Daniel bring home the bacon for as long as he wants.”        LIKE US ON FACEBOOK | FOLLOW US ON  TWITTER 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Sara C Nelson	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/01/idris-elba-rough-james-bond-007-author-anthony-horowitz_n_8069432.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

Addressing the GLACIER (Global Leadership In The Artic) conference, he said: “The time to heed the critics and the cynics and the deniers is past,” the LA Times reports.         “The time to plead ignorance is surely past. Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone, they are on their own shrinking island.”    However, environmentalists were skeptical about the rebuke following his recent decision to let Shell drill in the Arctic.     SEE ALSO:  Obama Interviews David Attenborough About Climate Change And Things Get Deep  Cli-Fi; Climate Change Fiction As Literature's New Frontier?  Women In Sustainability, Environment And Renewable Energy: Climate Change May Be Gender Blind, But Its Impact Is Not    In a statement to the Guardian, founder of the activism group Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands (REDOIL), said: “Indigenous peoples of Alaska have seen alarming impacts from climate change already, and Shell’s drilling will only make them worse."    The "alarming impacts" she speaks of is not hyperbole.    Kivalina is an Alaskan island that will disappear into the ocean in ten years due to climate change, experts have predicted.    "...It's too late to go back....it's going to get worse," Colleen Swan, who works on a local relocation project, told ITV News.     Swan added "They (the US government) can talk about it now. They can talk about emissions. But it's still going to get worse before it gets better."    In December world leaders will meet in Paris to see if they can find a way to limit the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius.     Despite skepticism around whether this will be achieved, Obama's Alaska tour is perceived to be a final effort to add momentum to achieving the climate change goals  he set out at the start of his presidency.     In a bid to better engage the people at home, his itinerary will also include a trek through Alaska with TV personality Bear Grylls.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 05:47:39	Lizard Squad Hackers Take Down National Crime Agency Website In Revenge Attack	The hacking collective known as Lizard Squad have taken down the National Crime Agency website in a revenge attack following the arrest of six individuals who had been connected to previous attacks.    Lizard Squad's official Twitter account tweeted a picture of the collective's logo along with the phrase 'Stressed out?' and a link to the NCA's website.    Stressed out? http://t.co/5631pELDMR #offline pic.twitter.com/hxhAuSdoqq— Lizard Squad (@LizardLands) September 1, 2015      It's believed that this latest attack is revenge for the arrest of six individuals as part of the NCA's Operation Vivarium which is working to take down Lizard Squad.    The six arrested are between 15-18 years old, highlighting a growing trend that cyber crime is increasingly becoming an enticing option for young people who have surrounded themselves with technology from an early age.    Tony Adams, Head of Investigations at the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit said:    “One of our key priorities is to engage with those on the fringes of cyber criminality, to help them understand the consequences of cyber crime and how they can channel their abilities into productive and lucrative legitimate careers.”      The NCA is the UK's national crimefighting organisation, working in conjunction with local police authorities to tackle serious crime.    The NCA has since released a statement to Sky News highlighting that because of the nature of their work, it is unsurprising that its website comes under constant attack.    "We have a duty to balance the value of keeping our website accessible with the cost of doing so, especially in the face of a threat which can scale up endlessly."    "The measures we have in place at present mean that our site is generally up and running again within 30 minutes, though occasionally it can take longer.    The hacking group are probably best known for the Christmas Day attacks in 2014 against both Sony's PlayStation Network and Xbox Live over the Christmas holidays. The last, and most severe of attacks took Sony three days to get their services back online.      Sony's PlayStation Network, which allows gamers to play online, was taken down for three days during one attack.    The NCA responded a month later, in a joint operation between the UK Regional Organised Crime Unit and the FBI. The organisations arrested a 22-year old man from Thames Valley who was believed to be directly connected to the attack.     An 18-year old was then later arrested in connection to not only the hacking attacks but also to wider charges surrounding the crime of 'Swatting' which is currently sweeping through America.    After the attack, online entrepreneur Kim DotCom conducted a 'peace summit' with the founding members of the hacking group resulting in a declaration that the group would no longer target PSN and Xbox Live.    Lizard Squad, Finest Squad, Anonymous and myself did a peace summit via @KEEMSTARx. The Agreement: No more attacks against Xbox & PSN.— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) December 28, 2014      After the attacks, Lizard Squad started offering a specialised collection of hacking tools which would allow customers to pay for the software and then carry out their own Dedicated Denial of Service attacks using Lizard Squad's infrastructure.    The DDoS attack would allow almost anyone to target a website of their choice and then overload it with traffic, with the end result being that the website eventually has to shut down.    It's believed that those most recently arrested were customers of this service.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 05:57:30	UK's EU Referendum Question Should Be 'Remain Or Leave' Not 'Yes Or No' - Watchdog Says	Britain's In-Out referendum on the EU should not be a 'Yes' or 'No' question, election watchdogs have recommended.    In what is seen as a big boost to the Eurosceptic 'Brexit' campaign, the Electoral Commission ruled that the question in the referendum should instead be framed to remove any hint of bias to a 'positive' Yes campaign to stay in the 28-nation bloc.    Within minutes of their recommendation, Downing Street said that it would accept the change.    The question currently in the Tory government's legislation for the referendum - which is due by the end of 2017 - asks: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?"     Ballot papers would have offered a simple 'Yes' or 'No' box to voters.    But following public concern, the Commission has recommended that the question should be amended to: ‘Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?’    It said that voters should be allowed to tick either ‘Remain a member of the European Union’ or ‘Leave the European Union’ on their ballot paper.    Following No.10's swift adoption of the plan, this is how the ballot paper will now look:        The Prime Minister's official spokeswoman said that he had decided that he would adopt their plan swiftly and the current EU referendum bill would be amended when it returns to Parliament on September 7.    "We will accept the Electoral Commission recommendation and we will table an amendment to the bill accordingly," she said.    "The Prime Minister's objective has always been very clear - to give people a very simple, clear choice. And we believe that will still be achieved with the recommendation from the Commission today."    Tory Eurosceptic MEP Dan Hannan welcomed the shift.    I'm glad the PM has accepted the Electoral Commission's recommendation on a fair question in the EU vote. Rigged ballots settle nothing.— Daniel Hannan (@DanHannanMEP) September 1, 2015      And Dominic Cummings, the coordinator of the 'Out' campaign, tweeted that little money had been spent on 'No' logos.    We revived old 'no' brand so cd get going w/out xpnd any £ & safeguarded v qstion change. V good news Gvt finally listened to Electoral Cmsn— odysseanproject (@odysseanproject) September 1, 2015      Will Straw, executive director of the In campaign, insisted the question was not as important as the substance of the issue.    Good to see @ElectoralCommUK clarify EU ref Q. V much looking forward to making case about Britain’s future no matter what the wording.— Will Straw (@wdjstraw) September 1, 2015      Jenny Watson, Chair of the Electoral Commission said: “Any referendum question must be as clear as possible so that voters understand the important choice they are being asked to make. We have tested the proposed question with voters and received views from potential campaigners, academics and plain language experts.    ‘Whilst voters understood the question in the Bill some campaigners and members of the public feel the wording is not balanced and there was a perception of bias. The alternative question we have recommended addresses this. It is now for Parliament to discuss our advice and decide which question wording should be used."    In the Scottish independence referendum last year, some claimed that the Yes camp won several extra points simply because it had the advantage of a 'positive' message.    Some Eurosceptics have argued that in making the EU questions a Yes/No, David Cameron risked similar bias, this time in persuading voters to remain in the UK.    But others argue that of bigger importance is the whole issue of 'purdah' and the Prime Minister's attempt to suspend usual rules preventing Whitehall being used during a referendum campaign.    Paul Goodman, of ConservativeHome website pointed out how the independent watchdog was worried about bias in all areas.    Since @David_Cameron accepts Electoral Commission's view on EU poll question - & good for him - why won't he also accept its view on purdah?— Paul Goodman (@PaulGoodmanCH) September 1, 2015      A source in the Business for Britain campaign told The Huffington Post UK that they were happy to now be part of a 'Leave' campaign rather than a 'No' campaign but purdah rules were still crucial.    Eurosceptics believe the Government, as well as Brussels, will use the full weight of their official machine to distribute leaflets and information to try to persuade Britons to stay in the EU.    No.10 today said that it was continuing to look at the issue of purdah and would include proposals 'shortly'.    However it came under attack from some Tories over reports that Mr Cameron was set to water down his demands for reforms to EU employment rights.    The Financial Times today reported that the Prime Minister was set to abandon any attempt at a full opt-out of employment and social chapter rights.    But Boris Johnson told LBC: "I looked at the headlines this morning about the possibility of Britain dropping its insistence on changes to employment law and I thought that was very disappointing. I think we need to move forward on that."    Mr Hannan pointed out that Mr Cameron had been promising to repatriate employment policy since 2005 and it now appeard that 'even that' had been dropped.    Downing Street said that the report was just 'speculation' but added 'we are not going to give a detailed commentary' on his renegotiation plan.    His official spokeswoman said that the PM had raised in a speech in November 2014 the idea of trying to make more EU migrants have a job offer before coming to the UK and wanted to 'get closer' to that outcome.

The couple recently reunited after a month apart, and now that they’ve moved into their new home, Kerry and George have explained their reasons for briefly parting.       The couple have had a tough time in recent months    In the revealing chat, the duo discuss George’s depression, and Bell’s Palsy, with the builder explaining: “Everybody has seen Kerry get depressed but when that happened to me it really hit me.    “I am vain - when one side of my face wasn’t working it felt like the end of the world to me. I tend not to show my emotions so it all just crept up on me.     “I will hold my hands up; I wasn’t a nice person to live with.”    Kerry adds: “George became a bit paranoid about going out or doing anything because he felt like a monster.    “Even with half his face not working, he is still better looking than all of my exes put together!”    After encountering relationship problems, Kerry and George met with a relationship counsellor, and the Atomic Kitten star credits the sessions with saving her marriage.     “We’ve been in floods of tears,” she states. “The conclusion was that we were both madly in love with each other.”      Kerry and George will celebrate their first wedding anniversary this month    While the couple are now happy in their new home, it hasn’t all been smooth-sailing, and her teenage daughter Lilly recently took to Twitter to share an open letter to her new neighbours, when they hit out at her mum when she and her family moved to Crowborough in East Sussex.    “Dear Crowborough, It's Lilly here one of the newest locals, I'm excited to meet you all apart from a little hate going round please remember everyone who is hiding behind screens typing hurtful words you are not just slagging off my mum but her children too!” she wrote. "Except I would love to thank everyone else in my new village for standing up for us all so excited to meet you all and know that once you know us and my mum we'll all get on."

Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on 'This Morning'    "I've got a really nervous belly," Holly admitted. "It's fine. It's like coming home, it's lovely. It's nice to be here," she told viewers, as she and Phil joked that they’d not had the money to refurbish the show’s studio as promised.     However, it was then revealed that the duo were stood in front of a green-screen showing the studio in the middle of renovations, before it was dropped to reveal the sparkling new set.       The 'This Morning' set has had a massive overhaul    Holly and Phil then introduced viewers to the different areas of their new TV playground, where she took the opportunity to test out the show’s new sofa by lying down on it.     "It feels so much bigger. It's the same studio, it feels like we've got more space," Holly said.       Holly tested out the show's new sofa      The duo took a tour of the new studio    She then caught up with the show’s resident experts including agony aunt Denise Robertson, and showbiz correspondent Rylan Clark, before sitting down for a proper chat with Phil about her year off.       Holly caught up with the team of resident experts    “It’s been incredible, I’m really glad I did it. It’s a big decision to take a whole year off away from somewhere,” she explained.     Holly added that the latest addition to her young family had a surprising effect on her other children, Harry, six and four-year-old Belle.     “I find it makes Harry and Belle better because they’ve grown up a bit,” she said, adding that they had been helping her with their baby brother.       Holly and Phil have spent a year apart    As well as a new set, the first episode of the new series also saw the show receive new opening titles, theme music and logo, in a bid to refresh the long-running show, with turns 27 next month.     There was also a brand new addition to the team, in the shape of a guide dog puppy.     Viewers also have been invited to chose a name for the 11-week-old Labrador,  who will be part of the show’s family for the next year, while training to help the blind.       A new puppy has joined the team      Viewers will be able to name the new addition    Amanda Holden had been standing in for Holly, but said her goodbyes to the show in July, as Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes took reigns over the summer.     Phillip previously revealed that he found presenting the show with the ‘Britain's Got Talent’ judge “quite scary”, as he was always worried about her inappropriate comments.     “She kept me on my toes,” he told Heat magazine. “She has a faulty edit button and she forgets she’s on the telly, which is enormously endearing and funny, but occasionally quite scary.    “The great thing is she comes out with things. I’d look at her and think, ‘I can’t believe you’ve just said that.’ Even I wouldn’t say what she says sometimes and I often have one foot over the line. Sometimes nearly two.”    'This Morning' airs weekdays at 10.30am on ITV.

The company will trial a prototype vehicle at the Burghley Horse trials on 3-6 September.    Underlying the system are four cameras -- two on the side mirrors, one on the rear view mirror and another on the trailer.        A computer in the car will then combine the images to form an obstruction-free video feed giving the driver a clear view of the back, free of blind spots.     According to motoring.com, the system turns the trailer transparent after it is coupled to the car.     “When you are overtaking it is instinctive to check your mirrors, but if you are towing your vision is often restricted with large blind spots," says Jaguar Land Rover's Director of Research and Technology, Dr Wolfgang Epple, told the site.      Land Rover's Range Rover already features a camera system which lets the driver see 'through' certain blind spots on the car.    "Our Transparent Trailer project is researching how we could offer a view out of the vehicle unrestricted by your trailer, no matter what its size or shape. Our prototype system offers a very high quality video image with no distortion of other cars or obstructions.     "This means the driver would have exactly the right information to make safe and effective decisions when driving or manoeuvring, making towing safer and less stressful.”    SEE ALSO:  Land Rover Autonomous Car Technology Now Lets You Drive Cars Using Just An App  UK To Test Motorway That Can Wirelessly Charge Cars As They Drive  Mind-controlled Cars Tested In China  Apple Hires Senior Tesla Engineer For Secret Driverless Car Project      The system will also include a cargo sense feature to help drivers keep an eye on animal-carrying trailers at all times.         Using pressure sensors, it will monitor the load and also analyse the temperature to ensure animals do not overheat.     Land Rover say drivers can also check up on their animals via an app which sends a video feed of animals to owners' phones.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 06:53:57	Boris Johnson Calls For House Of Lords To Be Halved In 'Dignitas-Style' Cull	The number of peers in Parliament should be cut by half, Mayor of London and Uxbridge MP Boris Johnson has said.     The Tory politician called for a "Dignitas-style euthanasia" plan to reduce the number of those sitting in the House of Lords and claimed the 790-strong body was "out of control".     Johnson's comments come just days after his party leader and close friend David Cameron appointed 45 new peers, 26 of them Conservative, in a bid to rebalance the upper chamber's political make-up.    The House of Lords has now become the second largest legislative body in the world, second only to China's National People's Congress.    But quizzed on LBC radio on Tuesday, the Mayor of London suggested many peers - whom he referred to as "geezers" - "don't do much at all".      Rammed: Peers struggle to cram into the packed chamber    Discussing House of Lords reform, he said: "The whole thing has got completely out of control; something radical needs to happen there in the sense of pruning.     "We had a voluntary euthanasia plan in which you were told that you could step down.    "There are a great many of these geezers who don't do much at all. We probably only need about 400 legislators."    Johnson refused to say whether he would ever accept a peerage himself, if offered the role in the future.     July's Sun On Sunday    The House of Lords came under intense scrutiny last month, after one peer, Lord Sewel, was caught on video allegedly snorting cocaine with prostitutes.    In the obtained footage, the 69-year-old peer argued with one of the women about his daily £200 allowance from Parliament. He calls her "lovie darling" and says: "It pays for this."

The mysterious looking craft -- described as being 'reptilian' in nature -- was caught hovering around the cloud line with what appear to be two 'engines' located on either side of it's body.      The 'shape-shifting' UFO was reportedly caught on a low-res smartphone camera.    Well-known UFO-focused YouTube Channel Secure10 uploaded the video which they claim was sent in to them.     The site has posted a number of striking videos in the last month including one which reportedly shows the almost mythical 'Black Knight' UFO.    Spotted as far back as the 70s, the 'Black Knight' UFO is claimed by many to be an ancient alien satellite that has been orbiting Earth and observing our planet.    While many were eager to jump onto the bandwagon, viewers of the 'shape-shifting' craft have been more skeptical with some claiming that distortions in the video prove that it's actually a fake.     On YouTube user said: "Could be distortion caused by the editing software...How are you so certain this is real UFO footage.  Its just as important to disprove the videos you examine as it is to prove them."    READ MORE:    UFOs Outside The International Space Station: Why Do We Keep Seeing Them?

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:28:08	Full-Scale Military Drone Operation Confirmed By US DARPA Gremlin Program	The US' Department of Defense has confirmed plans to build an army of drones that will eventually replace manned aircrafts in a war zone.    The Gremlins program, unveiled by DARPA -- Defense Advanced Research Project Agency is researching unmanned aerial vehicles that can be launched mid-air by a larger aircraft.        Once the mission is complete, DARPA say these drones will be recaptured mid-air and stored for another mission, which could happen within 24 hours.    DARPA explains the program will be a low-cost way of helping US forces have better "operational flexibility."    "With an expected lifetime of about 20 uses, Gremlins could fill an advantageous design-and-use space between existing models of missiles and conventional aircraft," said Dan Patt, DARPA program manager.    “We wouldn't be discarding the entire airframe, engine, avionics and payload with every mission, as is done with missiles, but we also wouldn't have to carry the maintainability and operational cost burdens of today's reusable systems, which are meant to stay in service for decades,” he said.

The US first began using drones during George W. Bush's presidency and since then, it has become a regular weapon of war.    According to Business Insider, drone strikes ordered by Obama have killed 4,500 in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.    It also reports: while US drone "targets" are often deemed to be civilian-free areas focusing on potential terrorists, the reality is the death toll usually includes the innocent as well as the guilty.    In June, CIA officials reported the death of an al-Qaeda leader during a so-called signature strike, which targets regions based on terrorist activity and assumes those living in the region are engaged in terrorism.    However, the Washington Post later said officials had no way of knowing the leader would be targeted in the drone attack.

In a passionate speech, the Labour leadership contender called on towns and cities up and down the country to each take in ten migrant families as part of the UK's effort to help the thousands fleeing war-torn countries.    It is estimated more than 340,000 refugees have made their way to Europe so far this year, nearly three times the number who came in the first seven months of 2014.    Germany is bracing itself for 800,000 asylum applications this year, a four-fold increase on the 202,815 it received in 2014.    In contrast, the UK received 24,914 asylum applications in 2014.     Speaking in Westminster this morning, Ms Cooper called on Britain to show the same levels of compassion it demonstrated during the Second World War when 10,000 Jewish children were taken in by the UK.    She said: “We need to be able to look our grandparents in the eyes and say we faced up to the challenges and responsibilities of our time just as they did theirs.     “And we need to be able to look our grandchildren in the eyes and say we did not turn our backs.”    The number of refugees heading to Europe has increased dramatically in the last few years, with the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and Eritrea the driving forces.    In 2014, 661,448 asylum applications were received by EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland. Just five per cent of these claims were submitted to the UK.    The rise in asylum seekers has seen an increase in the number perilous journeys to get to the continent undertaken via Northern Africa, where people smugglers load them onto small boats and send them off to Greece or Italy.    The United Nations estimates 2,500 have died trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2015.        Migrants and refugees coming ashore on the island of Kos, Greece.    Ms Cooper said it was “time for the Government to pull together an urgent national conference to work with communities and councils to see how many places we can offer to refugees from Syria and the Mediterranean.”    She added that it was “time to ask cities, towns, communities how much they each can do to help.    “If every city took 10 refugee families, if every London borough took 10 families, if every county council took 10 families, if Scotland, Wales and every English region played their part, then in a month we'd have nearly 10,000 more places for vulnerable refugees fleeing danger, seeking safety.”    Dr. Lisa Doyle, from the Refugee Council.  welcomed the call for greater action from the Government, and said: “The rising death toll within Europe and on its doorstep requires Britain to consider how it treats refugees.     "The British Government must do some serious soul searching as it seeks to respond: will Britain demonstrate true leadership by enabling more refugees to reach our shores, or will it continue to close its eyes to their suffering by ignoring pleas for help?”    Ms Cooper called on community groups, charities, politicians, councils and many others to come together to help deal with the crisis.    She attacked the “the politics of fear and blame” which said would “paralyse us, and let this humanitarian crisis go on.”    Ms Cooper called “for the media to rise to the occasion, bringing truth to peoples homes, not giving in to easy headlines which sell papers by playing to fear.”    She also specifically asked Ukip leader Nigel Farage to join in the debate and help solve the crisis.    Ms Cooper said: “When I called 2 years ago for Britain to do more to help Syrian refugees, Nigel Farage supported my call - I urge UKIP to support this too.     “All parties need to avoid exploiting a refugee crisis for their short term political campaigns on Europe.”   	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Owen Bennett	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/01/refugees-yvette-cooper-labour-crisis_n_8070090.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:44:13	Human Heart Beats Outside Of A Body In New Transplant Method	An incredible new transplant method has been captured on camera, keeping a human heart beating in a machine.    The device, expected to save millions of lives, keeps donor organs alive after being taken from a body.    This means that they can remain usable for much longer before being placed in a recipient's body.      The device can be seen keeping a human heart beating    One patient who benefited from the device was Lee Hall, who underwent a high-tech transplant at Harefield Hospital.     During an interview he said: “It was touch and go for me, they said they had a heart for me but it was coming from a different to normal source – and that it would be revived in a ‘special box’.    "I said I didn’t care as long as it allowed me to see my son again.”    SEE ALSO:  Incredible Photo Of Transplant Recipient Posing With Heart In Her Hands Goes Viral (Again)  Man Undergoes Three Transplants Including World's First Skull And Scalp Transplant  Woman Sees Dead Brother's Face On Another Man Following Transplant    The box used to save Hall is named the Organ Care System and can also keep lungs breathing and kidneys producing urine.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 08:08:31	The UK Has Condemned Egypt's Al Jazeera Journalist's Sentencings - But Not Loudly Enough	The UK government's response to the outrageous three year sentences handed down to three journalists in Egypt has been similar to the response of the USA and other democratic, liberal and developed countries: minimal. Search far enough and you will see that our government has, in some way, condemned this blatant repression of free speech. The British Ambassador to Egypt, John Casson, put out a statement saying (this quote is the nearest he gets to outright criticism), "I am shocked and concerned by the sentences issued by the Court today... I am concerned that today's ruling will undermine confidence in the basis of Egypt's stability, both in Egypt and abroad".  If you can find mainstream media coverage of this, I would love to see it. It would also be interesting to see the media reporting that, for these comments, Casson was summoned by Egypt's foreign ministry in Cairo - presumably for a telling off - as they were an "unacceptable interference" in their legal process.    If you look hard enough, you will find that the USA has also condemned the sentencings. The State Department said they are "deeply disappointed and concerned" about the ruling and also highlighted the importance of free speech "The freedom of the press to investigate, report, and comment - even when its perspective is unpopular or disputed - is fundamental to any free society and essential to democratic development".      It is good that these statements have been issued, of course. However, as is typical with this type of case, they are just standard protocol and thus, unfortunately, fairly meaningless. If the UK really wanted to oppose this type of injustice (which, as a liberal democracy which prides itself on freedom of speech we should) then it needs to be done from a much higher platform. We don't have to try to be international police and tell other countries what to do, but as we hold the principles of free speech and freedom of press to be right then we have to reject, and make it clear that we reject, any breach of them. So when something like this comes up we need to tell everyone that this is wrong and why this is wrong from the highest level of government.    Unfortunately there are countless cases similar to this is many different countries. This one is special in that it has received a relatively disproportionate amount of media coverage compared to other instances of governments imprisoning journalists who they see as being critical or threatening towards their regime. Why? Because there are foreigners involved, or more significantly Western foreigners.  Peter Greste, from Australia, was deported earlier this year and was trailed in absentia. His involvement has created the high publicity the case has received. This is, in part, a good thing; it is a disgrace to democracy in Egypt and everyone is aware of that. However it also highlights the unwillingness of the West (governments and media) to get involved when it is just a domestic issue. We should challenge breaches of freedom and human rights in every case. Of course, this is by no means a new phenomenon - but this blatant hypocrisy from our government and media can't continue to go unchallenged.     It's no surprise that our governments like to keep quiet about things such as this; they must attempt to strike a balance between standing up for our values abroad and keeping on the good side of unstable regimes (many of which are allies). And it is true that, in some cases, you have to work with the regime, however wrong and unjust their policies are, as this is the only way you can influence them.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 08:24:33	The Krays: Back For Bad	Have you had a tough few days? Are you stressed out, pent up and ready to kill? Then perhaps what you really need is a little bit of R&R. But forget all thoughts of rest and relaxation and that masseuse at the Mandarin Oriental, Hyde Park - merciless though her deep tissue massage is - and head instead to your local multiplex. Because 46 years after being banged up, Ronnie and Reggie (serious R&R indeed), better known as the Krays, are about to be released.    Ruling over London's East End in the 1960s with a mixture of charitable benevolence and fear, they were memorably released, cinematically, at least, once before in 1990 in the eponymous film of their rise and fall.    All the same, a lot has happened in a quarter of a century. For a start, Ron and Reg are now long since gone; the former having died of a heart attack in 1995 and the latter succumbing to cancer in 2000, only five short weeks after being let out of prison on compassionate grounds.    Knowing that they were six feet under must surely have been a deciding factor, not to mention a huge comfort for those brave/stupid enough to audition for the starring roles in the 2015 remake.     Had the (in)famous gangsters remained with us, one can only imagine the performance notes coming out of Broadmoor and Maidstone. "Having seen the daily rushes, Mr. Kray and Mr. Kray kindly request that they are portrayed in future takes with a little more sympathy. Or else". In any actor's shoes, I'd have found it hard to resist not making them both come over as a slightly softer and more good-hearted version of Gladys Aylward, played by Ingrid Bergman in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness.     The upcoming Legend (nationwide from September 9), directed by the celebrated screenwriter, Brian Helgeland, sees a single man in the two main parts. If the trailer and advance reviews are anything to go by, Tom Hardy is a revelation, just as he was in 2008 when he took on the part of the notorious serial offender, Charles Bronson.     Now is it me or has Bronson always seemed like a circus psychopath and not quite the genuine crazy article when compared to the truly certifiable Ronnie? On the off chance that Charles is reading this blog, I should bring to his attention that I too have changed my name to someone more celebrated and from here on in shall be known as Gore Vidal and will be residing in the Outer Hebrides.     While hugely entertaining, it could be asked whether the story of the Krays is one that needs to be told again, albeit from a slightly different angle? After all, the original movie won many plaudits with some great performances, not merely from the leads, but from the whole supporting cast.     Gary and Martin Kemp as Ronnie and Reggie respectively delighted critics and audiences alike,  who had previously only seen them as a couple of preening new romantic pop stars. Unsurprisingly, they weren't acted off the screen by a host of co-stars, including the wonderful Billie Whitelaw as Violet Kray, Kate Hardie as the frail and tragic Frances Shea who subsequently committed suicide once Reggie married her and Steven Berkoff as George Cornell who Ronnie shot at the Blind Beggar in Whitechapel after Cornell called him a fat poof. It was the word 'fat' I think Ron objected to.      Then there was Tom Bell as the gloriously sleazy and slimy Jack ''The Hat' McVitie and the simply magical Jimmy Jewel as Cannonball Lee, the twin's grandfather.     In the latest version, we get a whole slew of other characters played with relish by the elite of our present thespian firmament. Among them, Paul Bettany (no novice to the British crime genre since he was the star of the brutal Gangster No. 1) as Charlie Richardson; head of the main rival gang at the time, Christopher Eccleston as Leonard 'Nipper' Read the detective who helped bring down the pair and Kevin McNally as Harold Wilson. Here, we even have Aneurin Barnard as David Bailey, Samantha Pearl as Shirley Bassey and Millie Brady as Joan Collins. It was the delicious combination of celebrity, politics and violence that unquestionably made the Krays the media darlings they were and remain so to this day.    Plainly with more of an eye on the American market than its predecessor and with Oscar glory firmly in its sight, a homegrown audience will also find much to enjoy and it will definitely be a big box office hit. And if it's not, well, the financial backers can always try seeking out one of the firm's old members to carry out a hit on the producers.    Of course, the Krays continue to fascinate for the very same reason that the Great Train Robbers  and to a lesser extent, the recent Hatton Garden thieves do. There's a glamour to them that we find irresistible. Secretly maybe we all want to be them, if only we had the confidence to get away with their crimes and our moral compasses were similarly a little off.    Seeing this movie will once again cause many to lament the passing of the former East End. And it's sadly true that this particular part of the capital certainly isn't what it used to be. The locals are now an uneasy mix of hipsters, Muslims and old residents of yesteryear who continue to hang outside the couple of remaining down at heel pubs, which still ply their trade while they wait for inevitable gentrification. Blink your eyes just enough and those wrinkled Bethnal Birds, as I term them, could be 50 years younger and wearing mini skirts. And hold on isn't that elder brother, Charlie Kray propping up the bar?    These days, Ron and Reg would unfortunately hardly recognise their old stomping, shooting, stabbing ground. Yes, Vallance Road where they moved to in 1938 is still there. Currently, however, a three bedroom terraced house, similar to the one they lived in will set homebuyers back nigh on £1 million.    You suspect the Krays would turn in their graves upon learning that the scariest thing about the area is no longer them, but the property prices.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 08:27:00	Corbynites: Labour's Chorus of No	A concerted march against Jeremy Corbyn's candidacy for leader of Labour is in full stride across the political spectrum. Right and left, neoliberal and neoconservative, all warn of the perils of Labour members and affiliates casting a vote for the unlikely front runner of Labour's leadership contest.     Over the weekend, the member for Islington North has been labelled both a threat to national security by the Chancellor, and, of living in an Alice in Wonderland world by Tony Blair.    Increasingly severe warnings fall on unhearing ears whilst 'Corbynmania' has taken hold of the political imagination and seen the veteran MP turn into a household name. For his leadership rivals, the endless coverage, allegations, voter infiltrations and interventions by Labour heavyweights has served only to drown them out of the contest.    Whether Jeremy Corbyn will emerge as leader won't be known until 12th September. Placed into the leadership contest to ensure a broad range of views were heard he now leads in the polls with 53% of first preference votes with a 32% gap against the nearest contender.      Greeted with derision, amusement and even elation by some Conservative MPs and supporters, some Tory MPs publicly and privately worry whether he could capture the zeitgeist of public imagination and emerge as a real contender for David Cameron's own successor.     Over some weeks, there have been warnings from Tony Blair ('don't vote for Corbyn because you hate me'), Alistair Campbell ('anyone but Corbyn') and Gordon Brown ('Corbyn would damage international relations'). All have been met by a chorus of 'no' from Labour members who struggle to see a difference between Tory full-fat-Austerity and Austerity-lite Labour.     Tony Blair has accused Labour members and Jeremy Corbyn alike of living in a fantasy world of political escapism, referring to Corbyn as offering a 'refuge' to those who are content to exist as opposition only and who are disillusioned by the ills of globalisation and an untouchable global elite. Many seeking the so-called 'refuge' of Jeremy Corbyn would consider Tony Blair a member of the untouchable elite he refers to in his op-ed.       For his own part, George Osborne has reignited the threat of the 'unholy alliance' that could emerge between the SNP and a Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn who could work to oppose renewing Trident. Writing in The Sun the Chancellor stated: "Now that consensus, which is so important for our security and reliability as an ally, risks being shattered again by an unholy alliance of Labour's leftwing insurgents and the Scottish nationalists".     Osborne doesn't consider that for many across the country the phrase 'unholy alliance' would instead more accurately cover the Westminster bubble and establishment.    Their warnings therefore, hold no water with Corbyn supporters since they believe the same course would be charted after the 2020 election by Kendall, Burnham and Cooper as by Osborne, May or Boris Johnson.    Whilst Tory leadership contenders bide their time to start their own succession campaigns and the Tories as a whole strive to cement their party as the party of the worker, they take the wind out of Labour's sails. Labour candidates must fight over diminishing territory to distinguish themselves from the pack, further compounding the Corbyn effect.     Corbyn's unlikely support from Nigel Farage alongside Russell Brand illustrates how his opposition to TTIP, his support for renationalising the 'big six' energy companies and his modest euroscepticism can capture distinct demographics where they overlap in agreement. A place where both Labour and the Tories have struggled to locate since the financial crisis.     Warnings that Labour can't win under Corbyn are wasted on those who do not distinguish between Blairites and Cameronites, New Labour and small 'c' conservatives. For the chorus of no voting for Jeremy Corbyn it is important to provide a platform - with a slim chance at the premiership - to a man who represents change.     Either way, the risk is worth it for those who no longer distinguish between the rest of the Labour candidates and their Conservatives counterparts who Corbynites see as simply more of the same.

Along with this conception also goes the view that such money printing, necessarily, would be a cause of inflation and that the government - because of this - rarely, if ever, actually chooses to print money. The views associated with the common conception are false on both counts.     Firstly, it is important to note that the common conception we are referring to really is just a metaphor: most money is electronically created, with no use of a physical printing press.  A better phrase would be to say that the government "issues" money, as the economist Bill Mitchell has repeatedly pointed out.    In any case, the common metaphor maintains that the government very rarely issues money, perhaps occasionally - a frequent example is the money printing of the Bank of England or Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing programs, used sparingly and only in supposed emergency.      This picture does not hold up, however, if we enquire into the nature of money. As has been emphasized by various specialists, money is essentially an IOU - government money is a government IOU, bank money is a bank IOU, and so on. This has always been the case, prompting the British historian, Alfred Mitchell-Innes, to conclude at the end of his survey of the history of money that "money, then, is credit and nothing but credit."      Thus, whenever the government prints or issues money, it is printing or issuing IOUs. Whenever it taxes or borrows, it is recalling its IOUs. From the logic of IOUs, it follows that taxation and borrowing destroy money - as an IOU that has been returned to its issuer is no longer an IOU. This is why it is inaccurate to describe taxation and borrowing as ways to fund government spending; taxation and borrowing void money by removing the IOU from circulation. This naturally leads to the question, how does the government actually fund its expenditure, if not through taxation or borrowing? In answering this question, we shall be able to eliminate one of the misconceptions of money.     The government is able to spend, because whenever it spends it issues new money. In terms of the common metaphor, whenever the government spends, it (electronically) prints the required money. Again, this just follows from the logic of IOUs - if you are the issuer of the IOU, then in order to spend or give them away, you must first create and issue new IOUs. We can conclude, then, that the government must print/issue money every day in order to meet its spending commitments. This should not be a contentious point as it follows as a matter of logic.    Now, the operational details - in the UK's case: the British Treasury account at the Bank of England receives taxation and borrowed money - may appear to show that taxed money is used to fund spending, but this is a superficial, arbitrary detail. As soon as taxation is collected, it ceases to be money, but a kind of trace is left over on government records. This accounting trace is then transferred into the Treasury account and then becomes a new IOU, renewed money. It would be essentially the same story if the government deleted the tax receipts and then printed the exact amount a few minutes later, though this would be pointless.    To emphasize this point, we need only recall that the government cannot, in a literal sense, owe itself its own money. This means that when the government receives tax, that money has no one to which it is owed - there is no "U" in the "IOU."     The second misconception is perhaps the more difficult misconception to rid ourselves of - the idea that printing money is inflationary. To show this, we must recall what inflation is. Inflation is a consistent rise in prices, which is caused by nominal demand exceeding the output of the economy. That is, if the demand for some goods (measured in nominal terms) is greater than the capacity of the economy to produce new goods, then an inflationary episode will occur. This actually allows for the possibility that the government might deficit spend (thereby increasing nominal demand) and if the economy responds appropriately (builds enough goods), prices might decrease. As the economist Wayne Godley noted, "prices can actually fall when the money supply increases."     Now, the sceptics of government budget deficits often point to examples such as Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe, to prove that printing money causes inflation. However, both of these situations were instances of contracting supply - namely, economic output in both cases dropped substantially. This caused nominal demand to rise above the capacity of the economy to produce new goods, causing massive inflation. Note, however, that this was not caused by the printing of money, but by contracting economic output.      Furthermore, since inflation depends upon nominal demand, it follows that printing money by itself will not create any inflation. This is because newly created money does not automatically contribute to nominal demand - it might, for instance, be put into savings or stuffed under a mattress.    It is quite clear, then, that - following the logic of an IOU - printing money is neither necessarily inflationary nor something the government rarely does. Rather, due to the nature of money, printing money is a common occurrence, happening on a daily basis as the government decides to spend. Understanding these points will help us realise the utility of money, potentially achieving full employment and price stability.

On Bank holiday Monday, he posted a video of his not-so-bank-holiday-activities, which involved electrocuting himself in the name of science.        On a quest to find out how pain changes with varying levels of electricity, he wired his own tongue and applied 4Vrms (AC) voltage at different frequencies. We know you won't, but please don't try this at home.        What he found is surprising.

However, after this point he reports that his pain levels decreased, despite the rising frequencies.    He argues one of the reasons for this could be due to nerves and muscles becoming less responsive to electrical stimulation.    Whatever the reason we are happy to take his word for it.

JSP Blasted For Comments About Prince George  The 'Loose Women' Have Just Skinny Shamed Cheryl, And Twitter Isn't Happy    The hosts of the ITV daytime show invited their audience to vote in a poll, following The Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde’s comments that she blames herself for being forced to perform sexual acts under the threat of violence.      The 'Loose Women' on Tuesday's show    The show’s official Twitter account posed the question to followers: “POLL: After Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde's comments- we're asking is it ever a woman's fault if she is raped?”    POLL: After Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde's comments- we're asking is it ever a woman's fault if she is raped? http://t.co/raAGqzKpYH— Loose Women (@loosewomen) September 1, 2015      The poll was slammed by charity Rape Crisis England & Wales, who branded it “ill-considered, insensitive and insulting”, and called for the show to apologise.      “This poll is completely inappropriate and Rape Crisis is disappointed that 'Loose Women' thought otherwise even for a moment,” Katie Russell, national spokesperson for Rape Crisis, told HuffPost UK.      “Legally, not to mention morally, rape is always 100% the responsibility of its perpetrator and no-one else.     “Through more than 40 years’ experience of providing specialist support services to sexual violence survivors, we know how often and how much those who’ve been raped blame themselves for what has happened to them.     “This shame and self-blame prevent the vast majority of rape survivors from accessing justice and stop many from getting the emotional and practical support they want and need after such a devastating and traumatic experience.     “A programme like ‘Loose Women’ could choose to use its high profile to raise awareness and understanding of rape, its impacts and prevalence, and to support and encourage survivors to seek services like those Rape Crisis offers; instead, they’ve reinforced myths and stereotypes with this ill-considered, insensitive and insulting poll.”     She added: “We do hope they’ll apologise to their audience and the wider public, especially the large numbers of rape survivors among both.”    Polly Neate, Chief Executive of Women's Aid, also told HuffPost UK: "Rape is never the victim's fault, but the fact that we are still having these debates in 2015 shows how far we have to go as a society.     "The poll demonstrates how deeply ingrained the victim-blaming culture is - a culture that obstructs women's access to justice and contributes to the incredibly low rape conviction rate. Women are often still inclined to blame themselves if they are raped, which means men are not held accountable for their actions."    The vote was met with overriding criticism on Twitter, with many viewers expressing their disgust that the issue even needed to be debated, accusing the show of “dangerous myth-propagation”.    @loosewomen have to say what a stupid poll,i feel your poll is more disrespectful to women,of course its NEVER the womans fault #stupidpoll— ǝıןןnʍ (@Wullie13w) September 1, 2015      @loosewomen How in hell did you consider this an acceptable poll to run?— 『エヴェリン』╯︵ ┻uʎlǝʌƎ┻ (@ryuuevelyn) September 1, 2015      @loosewomen Have you asked any womens' rape/assault charities what they think of your poll?

Good job.— Tasha Lianne (@Tishtash95) September 1, 2015      When the poll eventually closed, the amount of viewers who disagreed with the poll was overwhelming, with 88% of voters stating it is never a woman’s fault.     Hosts Ruth Langsford, June Sarpong, Nadia Sawalha and Janet Street-Porter also all aired their views on the topic during Tuesday's show.     Janet said: "If any women come along, as Judy Finnigan did on this show last year, and express an opinion that may be saying 'well hang on a minute, if a woman is drunk, and is wearing highly provocative clothes, she is placing herself at risk', you're not even allowed to say that anymore."    She then clarified her comments, adding: "The perpetrator of the sexual act is always in the wrong."    Ruth added that she believed Chrissie Hynde should not have been attacked for her comments.    "She's got every right to say what she likes about her life," the anchor said, explaining it was "a woman of a certain age reflecting on her life".    "These comments can be dangerous," June said. "Actually, the woman is never to blame."    "I feel sad for her, that she feels guilt about that attack," Nadia added.     It is not the first time ‘Loose Women’ has sparked controversy while addressing the topic of rape.     Last year, Judy Finnigan prompted a backlash when she appeared to defend convicted rapist Ched Evans, stating she believed he should be allowed to resume his career as a professional footballer.     The presenter was involved in a discussion with her fellow panellists, when she described the attack on a 19-year-old girl as “non-violent”.    "He's served his time. The rape and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape - but the rape was not violent,” Judy stated. “He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person.    "'It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink,” Judy said. “And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time.    "Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job? Again, even though he has already been punished?"

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 08:51:18	What Responses to the Migration Crisis Reveal About Racism and Populism in Europe	Debates surrounding the current asylum and migration 'crisis' in the European Union reveal high levels of structural islamophobia, anti-migrant racism and populism. A recent declaration by the Slovakian government that they will only take in Christian refugees from Syria is the latest in the series. European countries should refrain from discriminatory, protectionist, holy mission-type migration and asylum policies.      Proposals to pick and choose asylum seekers to be relocated or resettled in an EU country based on religion, race or ethnicity are clearly discriminatory and go against States' obligations under the EU Charter of fundamental rights. But such patterns also highlight the underlying Islamophobia and Afrophobia in the current migration debate. The fact that mainly African and Muslim migrants are losing their lives trying to reach Europe should be taken into consideration and raises the question of EU Member States' and media reactions to these deaths, opposing Christian and Muslim migrants.     Slovakia is not alone in this respect. British, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch and Hungarian government representatives and politicians have recently made xenophobic comments about migrants. Poland took in some 60 Christian-only families from Syria in July. The Baltic States are also becoming increasingly anti-Muslim, and in Lithuania there is a discussion about banning the wearing of the burka to prevent Muslim migrants from coming to the country.     European States' responses also feature other human rights violations, including police abuse at external borders, and a whole drive to outsource border control to accessing countries.     From an anti-racism perspective, the level of hatred and segregation against Muslim and Black migrants and asylum seekers cannot be tolerated in Europe. The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, must be firm in enforcing the fundamental right to non-discrimination in relocation agreements. EU asylum laws specify that individuals who qualify for international protection on individual merit cannot be denied it. If this provision is not respected by EU Member States, the European Commission has a duty to launch infringement proceedings.    The right to international protection should by no means be restricted because of one's particular religion or belief. It should not be based on the host community's lack of willingness or discomfort to integrate a (small) refugee population, or Islamophobic positions (in the worst cases).     Beyond this, these forms of hate and discriminatory speech are serious, not just because they infringe upon fundamental rights, but also because such comments by elected representatives and opinion leaders can fuel violence and attacks against migrants. In Bulgaria for instance, according to civil society organisations, 20 physical assaults, 14 attacks on places of worship, and 8 incitements to racial hatred took place in 2013 in Bulgaria. The groups most targeted by racist violence were Muslims, followed by asylum seekers and migrants. In Germany, several arson attacks against refugee accommodation centres have taken place recently and the number of acts of aggression against refugee homes  has reached 202 so far this year.     It is therefore essential that EU and national authorities step up efforts to implement their international human rights obligations and to combat xenophobia, Islamophobia and Afrophobia, including by condemning such forms of hate speech and ensuring migration and asylum policies respect basic human rights and dignity.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 08:55:14	James Rhodes, Instrumental: A Powerful Memoir on Child Abuse and Classical Music	      With his autobiography Instrumental, James Rhodes may well have achieved the impossible - writing a first-hand account of child abuse and its terrible legacy that is not just desperately needed, but is also readable and, well, even funny.    This book secured headlines for the attempts made to ban it - a challenge that was so severe it took a Supreme Court ruling in May to secure its publication. But though the implications of this trial are huge in what it means for free speech, don't let it define what you think you know about this book for this is a stunningly frank account about not just abuse, but also the healing powers of music. This is a book that is both terrible and beautiful.    James is a popular pianist who is creating a huge following as a result of his willingness to challenge the stuffiness of his profession and make classical music dynamic and exciting. Yet he is also a survivor of child rape for James was repeatedly raped by his gym teacher when he was only six years old.    How James managed to hold it together to write about his experiences I do not know. But as this book demonstrates, James has been in and out of psychiatric wards ever since. There have been very desperate times - suicide attempts, deliberate and unintentional sabotage of relationships and friendships, and a constant battle with a tsunami of emotions that make even the simplest daily tasks almost impossible.    For as James writes "you cannot outrun this stuff. You cannot hide from it. You cannot deny it. You cannot push it down and expect it not to eventually reappear." And this book is a powerful testament to that damage, and how abuse constantly works at destroying the victim, long after the abuse has stopped.            There are dark passages in this book, particularly the episodes of self-harm and James' description of the adults around him unable (unwilling?) to identify the cause of the changes in the young James' personality. And even the responses from some as James, 25 years later, finally starts to confront and open up about his trauma are god-awful.    But as much as this is a book about abuse and mental illness, this is also a book about music. For it was music that saved James in his darkest moments and it is his passion for classical music that gives this memoir its soaring sprit and its sense of hope.    James cleverly weaves this love into the book. Each chapter opens with descriptions on passages of music and composers that have inspired James - a manner that not just brings in music at key moments in James' journey but breaks up the darkness in the writing, making the book easier to read.    On the wonderful Schumann, he writes "[he] was one of several who suffered from severe depression, throwing himself into the Rhine and then, having not managed to kill himself, sectioning himself voluntarily and dying alone and afraid in an asylum."    Whereas on Mozart, James wryly notes "The world's most famous composer. It's quite an achievement and yet somehow one feels Mozart wouldn't have given two fucks." No, he probably wouldn't have.    And suddenly these greats of classical music no longer seem like obscure figures from history who played for the pleasure of the wealthy and elite, but real men with complex personalities, battling huge issues. Suddenly to us they become human, even relatable. And their music becomes relevant all over again.          For those who have seen and heard James playing live, this format may not be much of a surprise as this is very much the way James lays out his concerts. His passion to drag classical music out from the stale and deliberately prohibitive classical music halls leaps off the page as he continues his criticisms of the classical music establishment and talks about his challenges in widening its audience.    And he is funny. James is funny and this book is funny. It's a dark humour, yes, but come on, anyone who can observe about Schubert's Piano Trio that "this is the soundtrack of a man so depressed he started out his student days training to be a lawyer" deserves credit for that.    That James has found a way to build a life for himself beyond the abuse is extraordinary. But this isn't a rose-tinted view that all obstacles can be overcome. Even at the end James confides that "I've no idea if I'm going to survive the next few years."    For child abuse isn't ever something you get over or leave behind. And at a time when parts of society is still trying to tell victims they have taken too long to come to bring their abuse to light, that you can't cast aspersions on the dead, that not every accuser should be believed, James' book could not be more timely.    We need this book. That James found it within himself to write these words down on a page, to endure again what must have been unbelievably traumatic to write and to edit, we should be incredibly grateful for.    Instrumental by James Rhodes available in paperback from October 1, 2015. Also available in hardback and e-book.     James is also touring to accompany the book. His Instrumental show, including readings and anecdotes from the book and live performance, will tour throughout the autumn and winter.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 09:53:53	'The Danish Girl' Trailer: Eddie Redmayne Stars As Transgender Artist Lili Elbe In New Preview Clip (VIDEO)	Film fans have been given their first look at Eddie Redmayne’s hotly-anticipated film ‘The Danish Girl’, in which he stars as transgender artist Lili Elbe.     The movie tells the true story of Lili, who was one of the first people to ever undergo gender reassignment surgery in the 1930s, while the operation was still in the experimentation stage.       The trailer is sure to bolster Eddie's Oscars hopes    Even prior to the trailer’s release, critics were tipping Eddie for another Oscar, following his Best Actor win for ‘The Theory Of Everything’.    Eddie and the film’s director Tom Hooper have faced criticism though, with a number of fans arguing that a transgender actor should be tackling the role, instead of the British star.     Tom addressed the criticism during an interview with ScreenDaily, telling the website: “Eddie was really the person I wanted to make the film with, and I was very passionate about that.    “I was a great believer in him as an actor. I think also there’s a certain gender fluidity that I sensed in him, that I found intriguing and it led me to think he might be a really interesting person to cast in this role.”    “I felt that there was something in him that was drawn to the feminine. That was something that I felt he might be interested to explore further.”    ‘The Danish Girl’ will arrive in cinemas this autumn.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 09:59:35	What Is the Connection Between Leadership and Digital Stress?	Last week I was at a 'meet and share' lunch event with The Social Media Club Gothenburg in Gothenburg, Sweden, at collaborative workspace Entrepreneurial Hive.     The theme for this lunch was digital stress, a topical subject. Stress-related illnesses cause burn-out and mental illness and stress is one of the main reasons people are off work.    One of the questions we discussed was: How can we create digital health and wellness both in our private life and work life?     The moderator of the event, Niklas Angmyr who's an expert on digital stress, kicked off the lunch by sharing some ideas and thoughts about a better digital work life.         He started by telling us that apps and information on the web are designed to encourage us to constantly go and check them out. They are built to get us addicted to information. We form habits around how we work with them and applications such as the web, social media and email are all calling for our attention all the time.     When we carry our digital devices with us it means that we bring our work with us everywhere we go. It's right there in our pocket or on the table next to us. Our brain and body are never really disconnected from our work life.     If your brain is switched on all the time there is very little room for reflection and relaxing.      Angmyr also mentioned that about a year ago German Minister Andrea Nahles proposed a regulation to reduce workplace stress, which suggested banning employers from contacting workers after hours.     I like the idea of not sending emails in the evening or late at night. And if you work late there must be a solution where you can save your emails as drafts and auto-send them in the morning.     Ideally, digital tools should support us and help us work better together, but unfortunately they often have the opposite effect and cause digital stress.     Is it the organisational structure's or the individual's fault?     What causes digital stress is different for everyone. For some people it's the technical functions of digital technology that stresses them out. For others it's the enormous, never-ending flow of emails. One person I met at the lunch said: 'I always hunt for likes and shares, and I want my network to pay attention to what I do. In the long run this is pretty stressful.'    The big question is: Is it the organisational structure's or our individual responsibility to prevent digital stress? The answer is that it's a combination of both.     If you are part of a disorganised, under-managed workplace it's difficult to manage digital stress. You will find yourself constantly swimming against the current, which isn't sustainable in the long run.          If an organisation uses too many information and communications technology (ICT) systems this will cause issues when you try to get them to work together.     The more digital ingredients you add to the menu the more confused the dinner guests around the table will feel. Two common symptoms of digital technology overload are slow computers that take ages to start up and people not knowing how to use the different systems.     Bad meeting cultures     An acquaintance showed me his work diary last week. It was more or less fully packed with meetings from 09.30 to 17.00 every day. He didn't have much time for reflection. He also admitted: 'I never pay attention in all these meetings, I only listen at the end when we make the decisions.' I wonder how many people are actually in the mood for discussion and conscious listening when attending work meetings all day long.     A bad meeting culture is one of the many signs that an organisation needs to organise its knowledge exchange in a better way.     We manage large amounts of information every day and if you have better control over where it comes from you are going to be better at preventing digital stress.     Well-performed digital collaboration creates a more attractive workplace. And an organisation that handles knowledge well will also improve its employer branding.     Current knowledge issue: Knowledge is saved in email inboxes instead of in a collaborative space where everyone can access it.     Causes digital stress  Meaningless and too many key performance indicators (KPIs)  Strict rules   Too many meetings   Poor leadership and management   People keeping information to themselves    Prevents digital stress  Collaboration and openness   Well-managed meetings   Thoughtful branding and vision for the work you do   A continuous feedback system   Trust    Conclusion  An organisation with disorganised leaders and poor managers who don't care enough to set up a structure that works will create digital stress and an anti-human workplace.     Leaders and managers who care about the flow of knowledge and structure will be much more successful and will prevent digital stress.      Some tips that I jotted down after listening to the group discussions at the Social Media Club Gothenburg    Switch off the sound on your devices. Even if it doesn't disturb you it will disturb other people around you.     Write better emails and avoid cc-ing too many people.       Be mindful of the position of your desk so you won't sit awkwardly for too long and suffer back and neck issues.     Have breaks on a regular basis when you are working. This is very important if you are passionate about your work! One participant told us about her dog that used to remind her to take regular breaks away from the computer.    Some people found list tools such as Todoist.com useful.     Learn about information flow in your organisation.     Have regular ICT 1-2-1 sessions where people can go and ask ICT-related questions. People are much more effective when they know how to manage their own devices.    Get better at organising meetings and skip all unnecessary meetings. One company I heard of isn't allowing anyone to bring smartphones, tablets or laptops into meetings and as a result people pay attention when they are there.                 The Social Media Club Gothenburg is run by Maria Gustafsson och Lotta Gergils-Aston, both well-known networkers and collaborators, and has hosted monthly lunches since 2009. We were about 50 people at the lunch sitting around six round tables. After lunch every group shared their discussion on stage. The motto of the SMC is: If you get it, share it.

It's an amazing film that does a very respectable job of introducing kids to the competing and frequently confusing emotions that live in your head.     Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust are cleverly characterised as five cute cartoon avatars that represent how these feelings interact.    Responsible dad act aside, I couldn't help sitting there thinking what would happen if Pixar released an Inside Out sequel about life inside the ADULT brain. Imagine what that would look like?

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 10:08:28	Washington State University Professors To Mark Students Down If They Use The Term 'Illegal Immigrants'	Students at a university in the US have been told they will be marked down if they use the term "illegal immigrants" when speaking about migrants, while white students have been told they are expected to "defer" to classmates of colour.    Professors at Washington State University have told their students they even risk failing their class if they use the |oppressive and hateful language".    According to the syllabus for Selena Lester Breikss' 'Women and Popular Culture' class: "Gross generalizations, stereotypes, and derogatory/oppressive language are not acceptable.     "Use of racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, classist, or generally offensive language in class or  submission of such material will not be tolerated. (This includes “The Man,” “Colored People,” “Illegals/Illegal Aliens,” “Tranny” and so on - or referring to women/men as females or males) If I see it or hear it, I will correct it in class since it can be a learning moment for many students.     "Repeated use of oppressive and hateful language will be handled accordingly – including but not limited to removal from the class without attendance or participation points, failure of the assignment, and - in extreme cases - failure for the semester."    Lester Breikss is not the only professor to introduce the penalties, however. As Campus Reform points out, Rebecca Fowler, who runs the Introduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies course, reminds her students: "I will condone absolutely NO racist, homophobic, or sexist language or behavior. I encourage you to cultivate an atmosphere that is conducive to healthy dialogue and debate."    She adds:    "A Note on [In]appropriate Terminology: Don’t use it.  • Not “colored” person/s/people but “people of color.”  • Not “the white man” but “white men,” “white males,” or “white society”  • Not “illegal alien” or “illegals” but “undocumented” migrants/immigrants/persons. Note that the Associated Press (AP) has determined not to use it: ‘The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term “illegal immigrant” or the use of “illegal” to describe a person. Instead, it tells users that “illegal” should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally.’  • If you use the above terms in your writing, your grade will suffer a deduction of one point  per incident."    Meanwhile white students in John Streamas' 'Introduction to Multicultural Literature' class, are expected to "defer" to non-white students.    The professor tells his students: "Reflect your grasp of history and social relations by respecting shy and quiet classmates,  and by deferring to the experiences of people of color."    He then tells students they should question themselves if they do not feel angry while they are studying.     "Finally, understand and consider the rage of people who are victims of systematic injustice. James Baldwin wrote that people of color have an obligation to feel rage over this nation’s history of racism. If injustice does not fill you with rage, then perhaps you should ask yourself why."

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 10:16:33	Toilet Seats, Reviews and a Kitten	Up or down?  This is an important question that needs to be asked before you move in with a bloke.  And when that bloke is your boyfriend then things can get messy.  Literally.   August was a somewhat crazy month. Moving house, going on holiday, preparing and performing a solo show and bringing a new love into my life, a kitten of my own.   So being the busy person I am, some thing's just slipped my mind. I was too busy concentrating on all the positives things there are moving in with my partner.  Strong arms to put up the shelves, going halves on the bills, living with someone who is a better cook than I am.  Fabulous. But then the annoying things creep in within hours.  Tripping over trainers, man gadgets left out. And the one that everyone debates over. Should the toilet seat be left up or down?   After three weeks of living together, two of those weeks were discussing the retched toilet seat.  I came up with the genius point that after the foolish man has finished... you know, emptying his bowls, does he put the toilet seat up? No. Exactly.  I also pulled up a valid observation that when we go to visit other people's houses, has the toilet seat been up or down? Down. Thank you.  It even went as far as the subject being bought up on a night out with him and his mates and even THEY; the other man beasts agreed with me that they politely leave the toilet seat down whilst living with their ladies.  But my man beast wasn't having any of it. I have been left blue in the face and gasping for breath (no rude thoughts now) trying to explain it's only right to leave the toilet seat down but no. It's up every time.   I tried to do a reverse phycology ploy by putting the toilet seat up so he would have to put the toilet seat down when he needed a number two. But still, the toilet seat remained up every time I went to go.   It's got to the point now that I find myself going to the toilet in the mornings,  perched on the cold p**s splashed rim as I'm not willing to touch the toilet seat the instant I wake up.  I have however, found a comfortable position now. The side of the toilet where there is more rim to hold my arse.   Maybe I should just remove the toilet seat all together? Maybe I should glue the seat to the rim so it HAS to stay down? Maybe I'll build my own toilet out of paper Mache so we can have our own toilets?  Maybe not.   So another week in living together.  A kiss goodnight, breakfast in bed, and all the other good things that I have to be grateful for with living with my fella. And in case you were wondering, the toilet seat topic wasn't mention in my solo comedy show. Other things regarding this relationship was however. You can read all about it in my review.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 10:27:53	Johnny Mercer: We need to 'grow up' over Iraq, my 'gippingly' embarrassing Dove advert and why Tony Blair is my political hero	Johnny Mercer        The 2015 General Election saw 176 MPs elected to the Commons for the very first time. In a series of exclusive interviews, The Huffington Post UK is speaking to 15 MPs from the 2015 intake of the Conservatives, Labour and SNP. This week it's the Tory Action Man Johnny Mercer...          Johnny Mercer's first few months as an MP saw him embrace both the sublime and the ridiculous.    The former British Army solider, who served tours in Afghanistan, delivered the most memorable maiden speech of all the new MPs as he pleaded for greater help for soldiers returning to civilian life after combat.    Delivered without any unnecessary flair or showmanship, the Tory MP for Plymouth Moore View brought the normally rowdy Commons to silence as he talked of "a great stain on this nation of ours".    "In 2012, we reached a very unwelcome threshold when, tragically, more soldiers and veterans killed themselves than were killed on operational service in defence of the realm," he added.    Johnny was rightly praised for the speech, with even the most cynical of political watchers recognised its brilliance.    If that was the sublime, the ridiculous came shortly after.    An advert he had filmed for Dove soap was unearthed on the internet, and the ex-Army hard man was shown demonstrating how to get your skin nice and soft as he lathered up in the shower.    His tough man image was dealt a further blow when his wife, Felicity, revealed he had to shave his chest for the shower scene.    Here is Johnny Mercer's 15 from '15    1) Where were you born and raised?  I was born in Dartford in Kent and I then grow up in a combination of Purley in South London and Crowbrough, in Sussex. I’ve got seven brothers and sisters so quite a big family. I’m number six, so I’ve got two younger sisters, one older sister and four older brothers. Three of them went to the navy and I decided to join the army – I wanted to do it properly. I’m 33 now - and if you could put that in that would be brilliant because the newspapers keep saying I’m 38, which is starting to get me down.    2) What did you want to be when you were a child?  I wanted to be a soldier. I aspired to the qualities of soldiering. You grow up listening to your history lessons and I thought that’s actually something I would quite like to do with my life and lead blokes in combat. I enjoyed the idea of soldiering: living outside, going on operations, living out of a bag - it was what I wanted to do. I know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but for me that’s what I wanted to do.    3) When did you first become interested in politics?  I always had an interest it, but I never voted before. I became a member of the party just to be an MP, I’m no sort of political hack - 2015 was the first time I voted. The idea of joining the Conservative Party of the Labour Party or any party like that was pretty awkward but there’s things I want to do and I do want to use Parliament as a platform for change.     There was a couple of key, defining strands. The major one was on operations with the military and seeing some of my blokes really struggling with what we were asking them to do in terms of when they came home. I thought that we’re missing a trick here, we owe these guys something and it’s not happening.     I do feel we’ve got a slightly disaffected generation around about my age group at the moment who for one reason or another the whole sort of welfare thing has been fairly toxic. It’s got nothing to do with the money, the money will come and go, but the fact we were saying to people in Plymouth at one point: ‘Look the average wage here is £19,000 a year but if you play your card rights you can get £27,000 after tax’, I think it’s taking the hopes and dreams of a lot of people and that was a driving factor as well.     I think my city of Plymouth has had a rough deal from Government for quite a while. I thought ‘How am I going to affect these things?’ and I looked at joining the probation service, I looked at being a youth worker, and I thought ‘How can I make the biggest change?’ and I thought as an MP you don’t have a lot of power but you have a lot of influence and you get people talking about these issues. I thought: ‘Fuck it. I’ll try and be an MP. How am I going to do this? Well I’ve got to join a party.' I think they’re all slightly mad but I am personally a Conservative so I decided to join the Conservative Party. Does that mean I agree with everything the Conservative Party does? No, absolutely not, but I am personally a Conservative and I’m very proud of that. I think they have a fantastic record. When you come into politics from the outside people talk to you about the ‘nasty party’ and all the rest of it, but for me I haven’t really found that.     One thing I’ve found, this constant hammering of MPs by the media is not even close to being true. Yes, you have your bad eggs, as you have in every organisation, but I haven’t met a single MP, from any party up here, who doesn’t pride themselves on how well they look after their constituency. This idea people just come up here and ride the gravy train, again, I’ve found to be false.     This place is just a vehicle. If you start taking it too seriously you’ll end up going mad.        4) Do you have any political heroes?  I did admire Tony Blair. What I admired was his ability to get people to vote for him of a lot of different backgrounds. It’s alright preaching to the converted and going after your core vote, there’s no skill in that. The skill is getting people who are on the fence and who perhaps haven’t voted for your party before to believe in what you say and what you are doing. He had that skill.       Tony Blair after Labour's election landslide victory in 1997    5) When did you first stand for election?  2015.    6) What did you do for a living before becoming an MP?  I was in the Army.     [What about the shower gel advert?]  I got approached to be in this advert. Dove doesn’t use models – clearly, the used me – and I think they were looking for slightly overweight middle-aged men and they came to me. It was an advertising agency who asked me if I would like to do it, and I thought no, but then they put me and the family up in a hotel in London and gave us a bit of money, and I got to stand in the shower for four hours and get lathered up – what’s not to like?    When it came out, it was horrific. I was aware that it was out in the States, but clearly I didn’t tell anybody, but some little shitbag in Plymouth found it on the internet and sent it to the local paper, and a day later I was on page 3 of the Guardian, page 2 of the Express. Big full size pictures of me in the shower. It was gippingly embarrassing. It was filmed a while ago – February 2014. It’s one of a long list of things that people take the piss out of me for.            7) What do you do to relax?  I like to go running on the moor at home. I live in a small little cottage on the moor with my children and my wife in the middle of nowhere. I like to go out on the moor. I like going out on boats. Things like that – outdoor stuff.    8) If you could run any Government department, which would it be?  Defence, clearly. That would be good fun but things like that are a long way off. If you try and do too much you’re never going to achieve it. Whenever I speak to the media I make sure I talk about one of four things, even if it’s ‘Come on and talk about your advert’ or whatever. Veterans, mental health, young people and Plymouth, those four things. If I can get that into every interview then I’m happy.    The way the military and foreign policy has been managed over the last 12 years hasn’t been ideal. It’s got an awful lot better of late and the issues are being resolved. For me to do my old job for example, if I was to do a kinetic strike on a target I would have to fill a number of criteria to make sure it was the right bloke in the right car, so I was killing the right guy essentially. It’s pretty tricky when it seems that due diligence isn’t done on a political level. It does make things very difficult. But that wasn’t my position at the time. You do what you’re asked to do and you just get on with it. There are things I do think are pretty unforgivable, I do think we got caught with our trousers down, not only in Iraq but then it happened again in Afghanistan. It’s alright making a mistake once but when you do it again you start to think 'Do the guys at the top really know what they’re doing?' In terms of even going into Afghanistan, we went into a situation that was completely different to what it was painted out to be and consequently we got found out. The sad thing is that a lot of blokes die and we can’t get them back.     You look at Syria at the moment, you look at ISIL at the moment, you’ve got to look back and think ‘When have we faced an enemy like this before and what have we done about it?’ Yes there was an Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan but it was nowhere near as strong as it was Iraq. People will look back on Iraq and think the whole thing was a complete failure but there are aspects of that place that set a template for how we move forward. One of those is in 2006-07 there was a Sunni uprising and 3,000 people a month were being killed on the streets of Bagdad and into that went Petraeus and couple of American generals and they went network hunting. These guys, these organisations, have a network and you go on a 24/7 intelligence-led network striking capability. The answer to dealing with ISIS lies around that.     The brutal truth is the more you kill, yes they are going to get replaced, but the skill set required to stay on the run for a long time often dies with the man who has gone. So yes, they will get replaced with a younger person and it will keep coming, but eventually, you will, as proved in Iraq, you can get on top of these insurgents. It’s not an impossible problem, but I do think we need the political will to say to our operators that we are giving you the political backing to do what you think needs to be done to control this. If we don’t, with Syria in particular and we saw this…we’ve got brilliant security sources and police in this country conducting what you call ‘goal-line defence’, trying to stop people coming in, you’re never going to stop everybody doing that. If we don’t get a grip on ISIL then I think it may get closer.     Some of us have a duty to win the public argument. This idea of ‘intervention’ and bombing and so on, it’s got a very bad press because foreign intervention in the last 12-15 years hasn’t worked out as some would like. But the idea we can look at that and then never intervene is false. We need to grow up and move on from the Iraq debate. Learn the lessons. The idea that Britain has a shrinking role in the world is wrong.      Johnny with his wife, Felicity    9) What is your favourite film?  I saw a brilliant one called The Intouchables, I thoroughly recommend watching it and that’s my favourite film at the moment. Brilliant film, fantastic story.    10) Who is your favourite band/artist?  I quite like things like Jay Z and Kanye West, but I think Kanye West has definitely gone off the boil. I loved Jay Z’s set at Glastonbury set a couple of years ago where Noel Gallagher was like ‘he doesn’t belong’ and Jay Z plays it out and comes out with a fucking guitar strapped to his chest – I thought it was brilliant.      Jay Z at Glastonbury in 2008    11) What is the best thing about the House of Commons?  The access to information and your ability to speak to people and make a change. The best thing about it is I gave what was essentially a pretty averagely delivered speech about veterans and mental health, but  the truth is these issues really matter to a lot of people and it got picked up on. It gives you a brilliant platform to go out and win the arguments that need to be won.    12) What is the worst thing about the House of Commons?  You can’t find your way anywhere. There’s no maps, there’s no nothing, and when you’re tired and slightly hungover it can be a bit tedious constantly getting lost. If you take the wrong turning all the doors look the same and my one always goes into the kitchen so I think they think I’m a compulsive eater or trying to steal some food. I walked into the Leader of the Opposition’s office but fortunately no one was in there.    13) What is the one thing you would change about UK politics if you could?  I would make it more touchable, more tangible for the ordinary person on the street. There’s a gap between politicians and those they represent and I would like to try and close that in any small way I can. I’ve got a few mad ideas like direct democracy that I did for hunting, where people get to vote on it. I’m not sure that’s the right answer but I’m determined to keep working at it to see what we can do to make people feel more in touch with this place. Ultimately this is the people’s parliament, it’s not about us, it’s not about the Government, it’s about the people who voted for us, the people in Plymouth who struggle on welfare, the people who are in very low paid jobs, this is what it’s there for and I think I try and really focus on that regard.    14) What one reason would you give someone to visit your constituency?  Plymouth - it’s one of the most beautiful, natural harbours in the world. If we developed it properly it could be like San Francisco.      Plymouth - Britain's San Francisco    15) What are the best and worst aspects of your personality?   Best is I’m quite focused. If I want to achieve something I generally get it done. Worst is also that – I can be fairly exclusive in what I’m trying to do. It’s very mission-focused, but it could be a plethora of missions, it’s not just one individual issue. I’ve got these four things I want to address, absolutely focused on that. If you try and dilute yourself too much you won’t get anything done. I’ve got some clear aims I want to achieve, like with veteran’s care I want to change the term of what a veteran means in this country. I want to get kite marks on charities. That’s where I’m focused at the moment. I think if I was to try and build a career in the House of Commons it would be over before I knew it. My sole aim is to still be an MP in five years time. That’s it.    .articleBody div.feature-section, .entry div.feature-section{width:55%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;} .articleBody span.feature-dropcap, .entry span.feature-dropcap{float:left;font-size:72px;line-height:59px;padding-top:4px;padding-right:8px;padding-left:3px;} div.feature-caption{font-size:90%;margin-top:0px;} 	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Owen Bennett	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/01/johnny-mercer-we-need-to-_n_8070974.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

In an interview with The Times, Cox explained how recent images captured by the New Horizons probe could act as evidence for life on the dwarf planet.    "The probe 'showed you that there may well be a subsurface ocean on Pluto," he told The Times.        "[This] means - if our understanding of life on Earth is even slightly correct - that you could have living things there."    In June, NASA released a series of stunning images showing Pluto's icy mountain ranges as high as the Rockies.      An image provided by NASA shows a region near Pluto's equator with a range of mountains captured by the New Horizons spacecraft    Cox believes that underneath the mountains, is an ocean warm enough to host organic chemistry that could hold the beginnings of life.    He later clarified on Twitter, "to be precise, liquid water is necessary but not sufficient for life, and there might be subsurface liquid water on Pluto," the Daily Mail reports.    However, during his interview, he did warn against getting over excited about the possibility of finding alien life.

In a blog for The Huffington Post, Astronomer Royal voiced his support for the endeavour, saying "searches for alien life are worth the gamble, even if the odds are against us..."

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:03:21	Louise Mensch Tells Aspiring Students To Defy Doubters And Aim For Educational Heights	Former Tory MP and Oxbridge graduate Lousie Mensch has encouraged aspirational teenagers to pursue their dreams and apply to top-tier universities in the face of adversity or lack of support from teachers.    The 44-year-old author detailed the inspiring story of how her own sister had become the "first undegraduate ever to arrive at Cambridge with a baby", going on to achieve a 2:1 and becoming the youngest partner to hold a position at her graduate headhunter firm.    She called on both boys and girls to defy their critics, and rallied young women in particular to apply for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, where female representation in both study and professional fields is lacking.    In a series of tweets posted on Tuesday, Mensch told her almost 100,000 followers to "never ever listen to a teacher who tells you NOT to apply for Oxbridge. Try. Apply."    I do hope any girls reading me in STEM apply to Oxbridge. If about to start that school year. Apply. try. It's worth it. Try.— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Loads of my teachers told me not to bother to try for Oxbridge entry as I wasn't clever enough. Disappointing O levels. I didn't listen— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Girls (and boys) never ever listen to a teacher who tells you NOT to apply for Oxbridge. Try. Apply. I got in and had time of my life there.— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      She added that those who did not make it to one of the top two universities in the UK should not feel disheartened, as they could still "have a wonderful university experience elsewhere", but advised aspiring students to "try and get in to the best university you can".    PS this does not mean you can't have a wonderful university experience elsewhere, but try to get in to the best university you can.— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      She went on to explain the story of her sister, Milly, who faced hardship after being expelled from school because she became pregnant and was rejected from Oxford University.     My sister Tilly did not get into Oxford. She waited applied to Cambridge. Was pregnant & expelled from our school. St. John's accepted her— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Thank you Cambridge. My sister was first undergraduate ever to arrive at Cambridge with baby. St. John's were wonderful. Apply— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      When she was 25 my sister was the youngest ever partner at Heidrick & Struggles. Thank you Cambridge. Apply there.— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Cambridge i/v-er opened letter from school in my sister's interview. 'Wow, they really don't like you do they,' she said. Gave her place— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Mensch also gave other examples of famous women who had graduated from STEM fields, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Ameenah Gurib, President of Mauritius.     Also girls studying STEM: Angela Merkel: Chemist. Margaret Thatcher: Chemist. Pres of Mauritius now: Chemist. Go for it :)— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) September 1, 2015      Her series of supportive message prompted many other Twitter users to post their own experiences, in a bid to encourage others to defy unsupportive superiors.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:05:52	'I'm A Celebrity' 2015: 'X Factor' Winner James Arthur Heading Down Under?	Former ‘X Factor’ winner and all-round cuddle monster James Arthur has become the latest star rumoured to be appearing on the new series of ‘I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here’.    READ MORE:  What Happened To The Contestants Of 'X Factor' Past?  The 20 Best 'X Factor' Auditions Ever    The Mirror claim that James - who turned down a spot in the ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ house last year - is heading into the jungle later this year, in order to give the public a chance to see the real him, following his recent, very public, controversies.     James’s pop career started out well enough, with his winner’s single ‘Impossible’ topping the UK singles chart upon its release, becoming the fastest-selling ‘X Factor’ winner's single in the show’s history.      James Arthur    However, it didn’t take long for things to turn sour, and after the release of his first original track ‘You’re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You’, he began to make headlines for all the wrong reasons.    Most notably, James was met with accusations of homophobia, after a rap diss he performed on surfaced online, featuring him using anti-gay slurs.    He was also met with a backlash over a public row he had with glamour model Teddy Edwardes, as well as sexism accusations over derogatory comments he made about his rumoured ex-girlfriend Rita Ora, in another rap track.    Since then, though, James has insisted that he’s changed his ways, and apologised to fans for his past behaviour.    Other celebrities rumoured to be taking part in the forthcoming series of ‘I’m A Celebrity’ include ‘EastEnders’ actor Jake Wood and former ‘The Only Way Is Essex’ cast member, Gemma Collins.    Gemma, of course, already had a brief taste of the ‘I’m A Celebrity’ jungle last year, but walked away from the show after just a couple of days, although she’s since been vocal about wanting to give it another go.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:08:17	Does the UK Have a Paris Climate Plan or is the Government Calling Our Bluff?	It&rsquo;s been four months since Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s new majority government came into power and there are just three months before the Paris climate conference. So, what do we know about the UK&rsquo;s contribution to the COP21 international climate change negotiations? Turns out, not&nbsp;much.  As world leaders meet in Bonn this week to whittle down country proposals for action into a concise document they can all agree on, it seems Britain's actions are speaking louder than words.  Last week saw what many fear to be the death knell for Britain&rsquo;s solar industry as the government set out its plan to cut subsidies for small scale solar PV in the UK.  Meanwhile, the largest new oil and gas field discovered in the North Sea for a decade just got production approval. The Culzean field has about a quarter of a billion barrels of oil &ndash; this is equivalent to 108 megatonnes of CO2, or, a quarter of annual UK emissions.  So how does the government&rsquo;s gamble with greenhouse gas emissions at home translate at the international negotiating table?  Documents released by DECC and published on DeSmog UK show that Amber Rudd, head of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has met with international counterparts five times (not including this week&rsquo;s Bonn meeting) since May 2015, in Berlin, Luxembourg and Beijing, to discuss the COP21 climate&nbsp;targets.  And, well, that&rsquo;s about all we know. According to the (very limited) information released, the department acknowledged that they hold briefing materials that were provided to the Secretary of State ahead of these meetings but have withheld all of&nbsp;these.  UK cuts support 4 renewables whilst promoting more investments in dirty energy. Great signal to #paris #COP21  https://t.co/F0vKGZbly9&mdash; asad rehman (@chilledasad100) September 1, 2015    @kylamandel if this was poker game - UK Govt would be called  a &#39;cheat&#39; for pretending to play climate hand whilst Killing renewables.&mdash; asad rehman (@chilledasad100) September 1, 2015    It seems that they are holding their climate cards close to their chest. So much for Cameron&rsquo;s call for a &ldquo;complete revolution in transparency&rdquo;. This leaves us to decipher the stream of mixed messages being sent by the new Conservative-majority Government: What exactly is its&nbsp;priority?  &#39;Ambitious&#39;&nbsp;Action  Rudd says the UK wants a &ldquo;strong, ambitious, rules-based agreement that makes the shift to a clean global economy&nbsp;irreversible.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Governments can set the direction, set the vision, set the ambition,&rdquo; she says. So, if the government is serious about addressing climate change, what steps is it taking to ensure the UK is in a position to meet its&nbsp;targets?  In July, Rudd made her first appearance before the reshuffled Energy and Climate Change Committee to discuss DECC&rsquo;s priorities. &ldquo;Carbon reduction targets are more essential than renewable energy targets,&rdquo; she announced.  Prioritising carbon reduction isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, but when this statement is followed by an avalanche of cuts to renewable subsidies throughout July and August, you start to question how exactly the government hopes to cut&nbsp;emissions.  .@DeSmogUK @CarolineLucas surely this headline is really &#39;UK Govt doesn&#39;t actually have a climate plan, and is trying not to let it show&#39;&mdash; Doug Parr (@doug_parr) September 1, 2015    This sends a &ldquo;worrying signal&rdquo; about the UK&rsquo;s commitment to tackling climate change ahead of the Paris climate conference, warned Angus Macneil, chair of the Energy and Climate Change&nbsp;Committee.  Fracking and&nbsp;Nuclear  &ldquo;Low carbon&rdquo; energy seems to be the answer, as Rudd puts it. Chief among these is fracking for shale gas and nuclear&nbsp;energy.  But, so far, neither of these options is being implemented as quickly as the government had hoped. Hinkley Point C is facing ongoing legal challenges and, should it be approved, it will be years before it&rsquo;s up and running.&nbsp; Meanwhile, despite Cameron&rsquo;s best efforts to &ldquo;go all out for shale&rdquo;, the UK still hasn&rsquo;t seen any shale gas extraction since&nbsp;2011.  Plus, as Lib Dem MP Tim Farron argues, to meet the UK&rsquo;s Climate Change Act objectives, we must decarbonise power generation almost entirely by 2030; any large-scale extraction of shale gas is &ldquo;a minimum of ten to fifteen years&nbsp;away&rdquo;.  &ldquo;If these targets mean anything, we shouldn&rsquo;t be planning to use significant volumes of gas for power at all, regardless of its source,&rdquo; he&nbsp;wrote.  And, with the gas price falling, nuclear and fracking are not necessarily more cost-effective options compared to onshore wind or efficiency&nbsp;measures.  All of this to say, the contradictions are astounding in statements calling for climate action yet attacking renewable energy in favour of options that have yet to be realised. Rudd is correct when she says: &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act, it will become increasingly hard to maintain our prosperity, protect our people and conserve our countryside. The economic impact of unchecked climate change would be&nbsp;profound.&rdquo;  So, is the government putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to securing a deal in Paris? We may not know until it&rsquo;s too&nbsp;late.  &nbsp; 	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Kyla Mandel	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kyla-mandel/climate-change-uk_b_8070554.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics
Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:09:05	The Rise of the Left Is Vitally Important for Scotland's Future	The referendum on Scottish independence was the catalyst for a tidal wave of enlightenment that transformed the country's political climate; suddenly, those who once found political arguments dull and difficult to comprehend were debating with their peers, sticking posters on their windows and rallying against the broken neoliberal agenda that continues to underpin and steer the Tory driven British establishment. Everyday people found themselves highlighting the damage that austerity measures and destructive capitalist policies have had on communities across the nation. For me, the most electrifying spell of the referendum campaign was in its final months: for that period, it seemed like everyone was an activist. You could literally feel the enthusiasm in the air - progressives from all backgrounds were bursting with excitement at the prospect of a social revolution by ballot box.    In the end, 55% of the electorate may have voted to remain in the union - but the vibe and growing culture of social participatory politics that the referendum created is here to stay: and that is why I am confident that a radical upheaval and transformation of our current political climate and its regurgitation of policies bred by inequality is inevitable. The cultural landscape in Scotland is shifting further to the left - quickened by each report of Westminster corruption, expenses irregularities or downright elitist preference from a swarm of champagne guzzling, out of touch toffs. The party of government, the Scottish National Party (SNP), are speaking leftist rhetoric; having carefully reconstructed their image as a single issue party to one that now claims to be the populist voice of the increasing anti-austerity feeling in Scotland. Whilst their track record does not match their new image: any party taking steps towards implementing more socially just policy should be encouraged - but, in the end, those of the socialist left should be mindful that they are a capitalist party, with a number of concerning links to big business. Try lobbying for public transport reforms when renowned homophobe and Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter has been (generously) financially supporting the party. That's not to slate the SNP: its simply being realistic, and if more of us could engage with that thought process then we'd have a much healthier political climate.    It's important, then, that there be a genuine left movement that can cohabit with the dominant parties and take seats in Holyrood. Despite the desperate appeals claiming otherwise from some red rose activists - that isn't the Scottish Labour Party. They may jump on the coattails of Corbynmania and ride it out, but do not be mistaken in believing that just because a left revival is brewing for UK Labour (with all of the internal battles and problems intact, that is), that its Scottish counterpart will follow suit.    So where do we stand? Where can those socialist voices disillusioned by the SNP and finished with Labour call home? Thankfully, activists and campaigners from across the Scottish left just drafted a fresh chapter in the history books. A new electoral alliance, RISE, was launched this past weekend. Consisting primarily of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Scottish Left Project (SLP), RISE is a collective that is pieced together by a host of campaigns, activists and voices of the radical left.         Following the Podemos model, RISE is set firmly on a path of introducing a new style of politics into Scotland - underpinned by democracy and a movement that represents the millions, as opposed to the millionaires. Positions already sound promising: elected representatives will take the average workers' wage, there is talk of term limits to avoid careerism, and - when it comes to funding - there will be no corporate backing, thus no ulterior string pulling. Democratic RISE meetings that have been held across Scotland over the last few months have raised some real interesting ideas: public ownership, democracy in action, strengthening the emphasis on equality movements.    The name itself - with all of its connotations of resistance and collective strength - is an acronym, which highlights the four pillars that will act as the movement's focus points: Respect, Independence, Socialism and Environmentalism. Personally, I'm excited. This alliance could not have come at a better time. Obviously, there have been accusations that it will unnecessarily split the independence vote - but this simply emphasises the singular narrative that many in Scotland have found themselves entrenched in: independence first and foremost, everything else comes second. Not only is this naive, it's dangerous. Scotland may not receive its independence for another ten or twenty years: in the meantime, there's an awful lot that has to be done - and are we going to give an incredible amount of power and trust to a single party for that duration? I'd hope that we are sharper than that.    My position is this: we have to build the left now - not after independence. Its vitally important that we do; thereafter, an independent Scotland with an already strong, organised and electorally represented left fringe will be in much better stead. With regards to 2016, we should be hoping for a rainbow parliament - albeit with a plural majority of seated MSPs committed to achieving independence - as that's how Holyrood works best; if we continue to allow for single party domination time and time again, then we run a real risk of ending up ruled by just another comfortable political elite with no opposition or parliamentary accountability - only in Edinburgh this time.    Let RISE fill that void, and give it a chance. Don't wipe them out just yet - wait, follow their campaign trail and you'll see that they're a very much needed breath of fresh air. And, when it comes to your second ballot in May - RISE with us for a better Scotland.

Gene Munster from investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray specialises in the technology sector and believes that Apple is finally heading into the realms of virtual and augmented reality.      Microsoft HoloLens allows users to overlay a digital world on top of reality.    He points out a number of Apple's previous purchases all point towards a company that is actively working on a headset either for the home or out and about.    Apple has indeed bought a significant number of companies that specialise in the industry including PrimeSense - the company that helped build the very first Xbox Kinect.    Munster reportedly goes on to make a bold claim about augmented reality saying, “we believe it has the potential to be as profound a technology platform as the smartphone today.”    READ MORE:  The HTC Vive Is The Virtual Reality Headset That Could Change It All  Apple Working On A Virtual Reality Headset?

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:15:37	Can India Become the Next World Football Superpower?	The 23-year explosion of the Premier League to all four corners of the world has brought out a passionate interest in football from many nations we in the myopic west of Europe often consider either uninterested in the world game, or more concerned with weird, backward sports like kabbaddi, or cricket. India is one of those countries.    Football in India is big business. Premier League pre-season tours bring in large crowds. There is a huge market for replica shirts, both official and not-so-official. There is even a football version of the IPL, the Indian Super League. The reigning champions are Atletico de Kolkata, and the star players include Premier League blasts from the past such as Elano and Josemi. Peter Taylor, Roberto Carlos and Nicolas Anelka are among the managers of the eight franchises.    All this makes it extraordinary that India, a sub-continent with a population of 1.2billion, a rising power with a history of sporting prowess and a love of football, has not produced one single star of note, nor has a football team that has made a meaningful impact on a regional, let alone national stage.    Currently, they're bottom of their World Cup qualifying group in the third of four rounds for Asia. In their last game in June, they lost 2-1 to Guam. Guam is a tiny Indian Ocean island with a population of a midge over 150,000. I don't know what microscopic percentage of the Indian populace that is, but the fact India have been beaten by a semi-independent nation in the middle of the ocean named after themselves, shows they are not a footballing power.    They do have the world's qualifying top scorer so far though. Sunil Chhetri has four in the onion bag thus far.    There is also some evidence of an Indian renaissance in English club football too. A Masters student at Loughborough University has become only the second Indian woman to earn a professional contract at an English football club after signing for West Ham United.    MSc Sports Management student Aditi Chauhan added to India's sporting history by signing for the East London club. Her achievements are further magnified by the fact that India currently has no professional league or training for female footballers.    The signing was greeted with plenty of positive reactions from Indian fans, with plenty expressing their excitement on social media. The reaction also caused the club to put the goalkeeper's shirt on their online club store.    She endured a tough start to life in professional football however, as they lost 5-0 to Coventry United in their first game of the season. Still, small steps and all that.    The excitement of a third tier English women's football team signing a young goalkeeper indicates that Indian football is ready for success. More success than Michael Chopra could ever offer. They just need a small selection of their billion plus potential stars to develop. It surely won't take long.    One more quality fact before I go. India have qualified for a World Cup once, in 1950, when England made their debut. They withdrew, however. For years the rumour was that they were sulking at not being allowed to play in bare feet. They actually couldn't meet travel costs. 	UK Sport - The Huffington Post	Matthew Smith	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-smith-2/india-football_b_8058066.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport
Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:15:54	Why Athletics Transcends Ethnic Differences to Bring a Nation Together	With Britain's recent success at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing, achieving 4 golds, 1 silver and 2 bronzes, you cannot help but feel proud of the team's achievements, transcending ethnic differences for a cultural identity of inclusiveness and support for one another.     Just what is it about athletics that makes it such a unifying sport in Britain? What is it about the sport which brings the nation together?    The success of the 'Super Saturday Trio,' Mo Farah, Jess Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford, have all served to renew our appetite for the sport and echoed the sporting enthusiasm we had at the London 2012 Olympics; that we can be a force in athletics, just as we are in other sports.    This year, we have seen stand-out performances from a host of British athletes, with many such as Dina Asher-Smith and Shara Proctor producing new national records, as well as women's hammer thrower, Sophie Hitchon, beating her own national record to place 4th in the world. Nick Miller also became the first British male to make a world hammer final.     The men's and women's 4x400m relay teams have also shown up well with both teams winning bronze. Martyn Rooney's finish being particularly electrifying only just beating the Jamaican athlete, Javon Francis to the line, to run 44 seconds flat for his leg.     For me, what stood out about these championships, was the success of Rabah Yousif, an athlete born in Sudan, but acquired British citizenship as a young man, in the hope of providing a bigger platform for his athletic success.    Rabah Yousif has found a way to repay the country who welcomed him in, by being the sole British representative in the final of the men's 400m at these championships and producing a PB to make it there. Several days later, he helped the men's 4x400m relay team win a bronze, producing a blisteringly fast opening leg.    Yousif himself was an asylum seeker, looking to forge a better life in the UK. The son of a Sudanese national sprint champion, he has taken that athletic inspiration, transcended from his family, and has served up a treat for Great Britain, producing his finest displays when it matters. What is more to come from an athlete now relishing from the backing and trust that British athletics have given him?    Certainly this country has seen talent who have been born overseas, blossom in representing Britain, with Mo Farah being a prime example, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, he has thrived in representing the country that had the faith to back him and invest in his talent.     Mo Farah now has 7 global titles to his name, as well as a host of European titles, being world dominant in the 5,000 and 10,000m for 5 years in counting. He is Britain's finest ever distance runner, but only because his schoolteacher had faith in him to become a success. Without that investment in his sporting talent from an early age, he may not have achieved legendary status in the world of athletics.     Perhaps the defining moment of the games for me, was the sight of the men's and women's 4x400m relay teams embracing and congratulating each other on their success after their races. That's the image of a team in unity, a team of varying ethnicities coming together to celebrate British athletic achievement.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:19:03	The Glory Days - Football's Old School Heroes	The Old School. It’s a phrase well banded in the world of modern football – a reference to the glory days and of legends passed.     It's the mullet, the 70’s 'tache - the blood-splattered centre-half whose first touch is a tackle, second a tantrum. The hard core player who fought for glory and love of the game, not million a month paypackets and lucrative sponsorship deals.     Today’s pundits can’t get enough of this term. It's pulled from the locker when there's even a sniff of entitlement, or a touch of arrogance on the field.    So what does it take to be classed as an old school legend, and can the players of today live up to the precedent?    Bert Trautmann        Born in Germany in 1936, Bert Trautmann’s career covered many angles.    A Luftwaffe Iron Cross earning paratrooper, Bert was captured by Britain in the Second World War.    Despite being a prisoner of war, he took to his surroundings surprisingly well, and after his release chose to settle in the country, taking up football. He was soon snapped-up by Manchester City - snapped being the optimum word.    For it was his neck break in the 1956 FA Cup final that earned him his truly legendary spot in footballing folklore.     Choosing not to leave the park, the goalkeeper - knocked-out cold by a knee to the neck in the 75th minute - vowed to retain City's 3-1 lead. So he stayed on.    Over the course of the next 15 minutes, Trautmann pulled-off a string of top saves, made all the more astonishing by the lethal condition he'd managed to get himself into.    It took five days for him to see a doctor, and the eventual diagnosis was the dislocation of five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked clean in two.     To put in context, most people who suffer that kind of injury usually die. Trautmann later admitted the last five minutes of the final were like playing in 'a fog'.     Sixteen years a professional and one trophy to his name, he finished his career managing the Pakistan national team.    Sir Bobby Charlton        To this day, Charlton holds the record for the highest goal scorer for both his club and country – no mean feat in today’s landscape of astronomical wage packets and state of the art training facilities.     Playing in no fewer than four world cup tournaments, he was an integral part of England’s 1966 world cup winning squad. A true character, Charlton holds a firm place in the hearts of Man Utd fans around the world.    Charlton survived the notorious Munich air disaster, which tragically claimed the lives of seven of his teammates – he was back on the pitch only two months later.     His heart, commitment and incredible skill on the pitch saw him win the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 Sports Personality Of The Year Awards. To this day, he’s a club ambassador and an integral part of life at Manchester United.     Jim Baxter        The hothead Scotsman was one of the game's founding midfield generals, yet a footballing genius.     A Scotland International from 1961 to 1967, Baxter was renowned for partying hard the night before a game. Despite this, the Glasgow Rangers icon was miraculously unplayable at his peak. He controlled games with an 'unhurried accuracy', and Sir Alex Ferguson even labeled him "arguably the best player to play in Scottish football". No mean feat, but still.    Baxter once asked a friend to move the date of his wedding to a Saturday - and to the same hotel Rangers ate their pre-match meal. Baxter shoehorned the wedding's entire bar tab onto the Rangers bill, and such was his popularity at the Glasgow club, they agreed to pay.     George Best        The Manchester Utd winger and Northern Ireland International was considered the best player of his generation.     Best’s legendary skills on the pitch were almost matched by his hardcore attitude off – his renowned partying ways often overshadowing the brilliance of a man whose skills were unsurpassed on the field.     Best helped Man Utd along on the road to victory at the European championships in 1968, a historic win that also saw him take the title of European player of the year.     His lion hearted attitude combined with a true sporting gift, “Bestie” as he was affectionately known will go down in sporting history as a true man of the old school. His often quoted evaluation of his lifestyle even more so – “I spent a lot of my money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered”.    Bobby Moore        Praised by Pele as the greatest defender he had ever come up against, Bobby Moore lives amongst the true legends of the game. He captained England during the 1996 world cup, leading the team to a historic victory that’s never been matched.     Not without his controversies, in January 1971 Moore and three team mates were fined a weeks wages each for going out clubbing the night before an FA cup third round match against Blackpool – the team subsequently lost the match four goals to nil, which against a bottom table team was badly received to say the least.     After his death in 1983, Moore lives on through several charitable foundations and a legacy that will live in the hearts and minds of England fans for many years to come.     So there's your Old School must-haves. A player who leaves everything on the pitch, and tears everything apart off it.    The terminology lives on as the one cliché that strikes fear into the core of the False 9 worshipping football hipsters of today. Often uncultured, never half-hearted, forever enduring.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:33:20	Variation on a Theme - Duracell's RWC	As a popular team sport in the UK rugby stands alone in terms of its physicality, football is on a different planet altogether and whilst American Football obviously isn't for the fainthearted the pads make it just a touch tamer in my eyes!!     If you look back in history a large number of the most memorable rugby moments fall into two categories; they are either demonstrations of sublime talent or manifestations of intense physicality. Brian O'Driscoll delivered a huge number of the former and when Jonah Lomu arrived on the scene he led the charge on the latter. Lomu changed the face of the sport forever as he showcased levels of strength and power that none of us had ever seen on the wing. Indeed many of the individuals that have left the greatest impression on our game have been ultimate competitors and those that have displayed immense physical prowess, the likes of Bakkies Botha, Martin Johnson, Paul O'Connell and many more.     As mentioned in a previous blog this Rugby World Cup is also a chance for brands to showcase themselves on the world stage. The modern and commercial world that we live in means that there are opportunities all over the park for brands to activate and sponsor elements of the tournament and Duracell is another to grab their chance.     On first thought the term 'square peg and round hole' springs to mind when you think of a brand that makes batteries and elite rugby. However like others they have gone back to the purpose of their product and looked at how that can link with the sport at hand. This train of thought has led them to work with the Rugby World Cup's data providers Opta. Opta's credibility in rugby is second to none, they provide all of the official match statistics (turnovers, meters made, tackles etc.) for the Aviva Premiership and will do so for the forthcoming tournament. This alignment to Opta instantly provides Duracell with vicarious credibility and a focus on the statistical side of the game also allows them to align with their own energy giving properties.    In short the #PowerCheck will track a combination of performance indicators including tackles, carries, turnovers won and discipline during the course of each game, with a greater weighting towards players that remain on the pitch for longer. The data then will create a score out of 100 giving Duracell something clear to talk and focus on during every match over the six weeks of competition.     Once again this is a simple but clear way of a brand linking themselves to the focus of the nation and like LandRover and Canterbury it stays close enough to the brand purpose to be seen to be credible and useful to individuals. As a premium brand I expect that a strong objective of Duracell will be to differentiate themselves from their branded competition and this activation will certainly be one method of doing so.    Now that we have reviewed a number of brands' activations for the Rugby World Cup it is time to head back to England's final warm up fixture and the selection decisions that rest on Stuart Lancaster's shoulders. This week will be a tremendously intense one for England and every single player knows that nothing less than a victory on Saturday afternoon will suffice.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:33:46	Challenge Cup Final 2015: Lizzie Jones Showed Me That I Will Always Be A Member of The Winning Sporting Family	So, what do you do when your team lose 50-0 in the Challenge Cup Final (yep, that wasn't a typo!) at Wembley? Emmigrate? Hide in a cupboard? Burn your shirt and pretend you never really liked them in the first place? Well, if you're one of the 2000 or so Hull Kingston Rovers fans who braved the rain on a bank holiday monday, you go to Hull's Queen Victoria Square, and you applaud the team for managing to reach the final.    I am thankful for having been there on Saturday. I actually enjoyed myself, despite my beloved team receiving a monumental drubbing. I have to admit that, whilst I tip my hat to my fellow Robins for their dedication and unwavering support, I wasn't there to welcome the team back from Wembley. I did spend the entire journey, and the week leading upto it with butterflies, wondering if we just might sneak the winning try. I did stare open mouthed as the Hull KR defence stood motionless as Leeds mounted attack after attack, and the scoreboard ticked over quicker than the electricity meter on Blackpool seafront, and I did do my best to put a brave face on, refusing to back down in the face of justified ridicule, and singing proudly until the train doors opened at Hull Paragon station once more, and we all drunkenly went in search for taxis home. But I couldn't bring myself to go on Bank Holiday Monday, and celebrate such an abject loss.    Now, pushing what was a soul destroying day at the office to one side, the weekend has given me a magical experience. The thrill of a Wembley occasion, the spectacular surroundings of the stadium, and a magnificent performance of "Abide With Me" by Lizzie Jones, widow of the late Featherstone Rovers player Danny Jones, who died suddenly only minutes into a game earlier this year. She showed that her vocals were majestic and strong, as is her spirit and backbone. I am sure that like me, the rest of the 80,000 Rugby League fans present at Wembley, and those watching at home have taken this spectacularly brave lady, and her two beautiful babies into their hearts.    Since Saturday, you can imagine the banter that has been flying around my home city, especially seeing as we have two Super League sides who both hate each other in equal measure! Much of it has been cruel, but much more has been funny, ironic, and comedically inspired! One of the best experiences I have had was mixing with fans from other clubs whilst negotiating the London Underground. Rugby League is much different to Football, in that fans manage to co-exist peacefully, and usually share the same pubs, coaches, trains and thoroughfares on match days with no fighting, save for the occasional idiot who infiltrates every community! But many fans at Wembley were not supporters of either team, and the mix of loyalties, accents and rye banter only served to make the day.    Moreover, the day, and the unexpected loss of a long time family friend on Sunday morning, have handed me a welcome chance to examine the tribal disappointment of a sporting loss in a whole new light. I am crestfallen. I am embarrassed. I am seismically disappointed. But I am still alive. I have met some great people. I still have my health, my job, my sense of humour, and my slowly receeding beer gut! Cup finals matter, as does sport generally, but that is all it will ever be: sport. Despite having lost miserably, I would be prepared to repeat the day all over again, and not just out of blind loyalty to my club, and to some of the greatest supporters in the world. I would repeat it again and again, because it means spending the day in the company of the Rugby League Family, and as an audience member of Lizzie Jones, who will forever be regarded as inspiration and dignity in the face of unimaginable loss personified.    The Challenge Cup Final 2015 taught me four things: Firstly, that there truly are more important things in life. Secondly, that Leeds Rhinos really will take some stopping if they are to be denied the double this year. Thirdly, that if the Super League and Challenge Cup were decided by the dedication of the fans alone, Hull Kingston Rovers would be double winners year after year. The fourth lesson I learned was that although I was supporting the losing side on Saturday, I was, and always will be a member of the winning sporting family.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 11:53:18	Yes, Tim Farron Is a Diehard Liberal	There was once a time when to be liberal meant to be tolerant of other people's views and behaviours - to allow them even when they offend or disgust, and even when they are thought to be immoral. The most passionate liberals did not just tolerate, however. They fought passionately for public tolerance and legal freedom for those views and behaviours. Hence Voltaire's famous non-quote:* 'I detest what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'    This sentiment is especially apt for another reason in particular: it has remained, to this day, one of the defining hallmarks of the Liberal Democrats' outlook. They have been fearlessly and uncompromisingly in favour of free speech, fighting to preserve the right of people to say the most wretched things, however much they contradict other Liberal Democrat values.    The Liberal Democrat commitment to free speech is one of their most admirable qualities, and it is one of their most defining ones. Rightly so. And this is why it is such a shame that Tim Farron is being castigated by fellow party members for his 'illiberal' views on abortion and homosexuality. The truth is that his views are far more liberal than their own.    The reason is fairly simple. Just as defending freedom of speech - however ugly or repulsive - is one of the paradigm examples of liberalism, so is defending the freedom to do things which one also finds immoral or otherwise offensive.    All of us have a code of morality. Most of us think murder is wrong. Some of us think that corporate greed is wrong. Some of us think that war is wrong. Some of us think that imposing morality on others is wrong. There is no high ground to be had in having no moral values. Not having moral values or making moral judgments is not 'liberal' or 'progressive'. It is not compassionate or open-minded. It is nihilistic and barbaric. Someone who doesn't take offence at exploitation of the poor, or who doesn't really judge child abuse to be wrong, has something profoundly wrong with them.    So Tim Farron is not unusual for thinking that some things are morally wrong. Vegetarians (usually) think that eating meat is wrong. Pro-Palestine protestors think that the behaviour of Israel is wrong. Welfarists think that the state not providing for the poor is wrong, while their opponents think that individuals not doing so off their own backs is wrong. No one who really grapples with the hard questions of politics or who sees their neighbour in trouble and wants to help can be satisfied with flouting morals. No one who loves the vulnerable can escape being, at heart, a judgmental moralist.    Liberalism is not rooted in these sorts of moral debates. It is rooted in the question of what we do with our moral beliefs once we acquire them, and once we meet and live with others who disagree. And, while authoritarians have traditionally held that there should be a rigid, strict and detailed system of public morality built into law for all to adhere to, liberals have traditionally held the opposite: that despite their own personal morality - which could be anything from nihilistic, to Islamic, to utilitarian - public morality and law should not be too imposing. It should allow for disagreements by being legally tolerant of them, in speech and in practice. That is what liberalism is - legal liberty. It does not mean giving up personal moral views, or changing them until they fit with the popular ones. It means being tolerant of other views and their practice, especially when they conflict with one's own.    And that is why Tim Farron is a better liberal than his detractors. Mr Farron most probably thinks that gay sex, gay marriage and abortion are wrong, however diplomatic he tries to be in his phraseology. He has done his best to keep these views to himself and not to impose them on others - it is news reporters and undercover aides who have tried to bring these views out of him despite his clear reticence. If anything, he has been bombarded with opposing views to his own far more than he has tried to impose his on others.    And yet Mr Farron has fully endorsed the legality of those actions. And these are no trivia: Mr Farron likely thinks that abortion is the killing of an innocent, unborn child, created in the image of God - on a par with killing a newborn or an adult. And yet he has stated that he is fully in support of a woman's right to choose an abortion. I suspect it is hard to find another Liberal Democrat who would endorse the legality of something they thought was that wrong. I can think of very few Liberal Democrats who would endorse the legality of the killing of newborns, and fewer still who would endorse the legal freedom to kill adults.    But Mr Farron has risen above his own personal views here in the name of public and legal liberty. He has done the same on the issue of gay marriage. And when he has abstained from votes on gay marriage, he has, again, done so in the name of liberty - because it was not clear that religious liberty would be preserved in the passing of those Bills. He is for the legality of gay marriage - and for the legality of opposing it or refusing to be involved in it.    So I cannot sit back and watch other liberals call Tim Farron's views 'illiberal' because they do not line up with their own personal views. I cannot rest watching them declare that he is not the strong liberal voice that the party needs. Liberalism does not come by adopting the reigning orthodoxy of 'progressive' and leftist ethics, while passing Bills limiting freedom for those who dissent from it. Indeed, liberalism can only come from strong disagreement, and the courage not only to put up with, but to sacrifice oneself for, those views and actions which one deems offensive.    Some of us find Tim Farron's personal views offensive. Others agree with them and are appalled that he could vouch for the legality of things which he already believes to be so wrong. But whatever the problem with Tim Farron, it cannot possibly be that he is not liberal enough. If anything, he is too liberal - for both conservatives and his fellow Liberal Democrats.    *While commonly attributed to Voltaire, this is in fact a later (accurate) paraphrase of his position.

A video, that has now been taken down, appeared online earlier reportedly showing the Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z5 Premium.    The footage featured an interview with Sony Mobile Communications' marketing director who appeared to be using a Z5 phone, according to The Verge.       Sony's Xperia Z5 will most probably look and feel like the Z4    What sets the phones apart from previous generations will be the screen size and resolution. According to The Verge, the Z5 Compact will have a 4.6-inch, 720p screen while the Z5 will have a 5.2-inch 1080p display.    The Z5 Premium on the other hand, will be the largest of the three boasting a 5.5-inch screen and a 4k resolution.    The company is expected to officially announce the phones on Wednesday ahead of the IFA 2015 trade that begins on Friday in Berlin.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:12:15	An Attack on Renewables Is an Attack on the Young	Our government really hates renewables. Last month, they ignored the public and the decisions of local authorities to force fracking on everyone. And now - unless we talk them out of it - they're slashing subsidies for renewable energy. It's as if they get off on fossil fuels. They act like clean energy has to be avoided at all costs.    Our renewables sector has been doing remarkably well in recent years. One of the main reasons for this is because of a policy called feed in tariffs. Put simply, this means that if you stick up a bunch of solar panels and generate more electricity than you use, you can sell the excess energy back to the grid.     It's essentially a very fair and effective form of subsidy, and has incentivised countless renewables projects which otherwise wouldn't have been viable. It's a great policy that was making the transition to clean energy accessible to more and more ordinary families and communities. It's the sort of thing we should be doing more of, wouldn't you think? Well, apparently not.    Sticking to their usual 'if it ain't broke, break it' approach to climate policy, the government has announced a consultation to "control costs" in this feed in tariff scheme. And when they say "control costs", they mean scrapping it altogether. Returns will plummet to an unworkable level from January, and they'll continue to degrade from there. They already rushed through one set of cuts to subsidies during the parliamentary recess in a typically classy move. Now they're going for the rest.    This is an ideological assault on renewables. Government says that the sector should survive without their money, yet we're still subsidising oil and gas to the tune of billions a year. And they've no problem strong-arming when it comes to the interests of the fossil fuel industry, who have almost limitless money to spend on lobbying. They've just granted 27 new fracking licences across the country in a staggeringly anti-democratic move, ignoring the public, and the rights of local authorities to make local decisions. They really, really like fossil fuels.       There are some simple facts we have to keep in mind here. We need to keep global temperatures below two degrees warming to avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown. To do this, we need to keep 80 per cent of fossil fuels in the ground, and transition to completely clean energy by 2050. Anything less than this commits us to at least 4 degrees of warming, bringing with it mass resource scarcity, unprecedented global conflict, and a very real threat to civilisation itself.    This obviously needs bold action. So what does our government do? They say no to solar, and reach for the drills. It's literally the opposite of what we need to be doing. They're locking us into fossil fuel infrastructure the public doesn't even want, and they've absolutely wrecked the progress of renewables.    This isn't just more bad news for the climate and the renewables industry. This is another savage attack on the young. Not only do these decisions push us closer towards the worst effects of climate breakdown - which is about as bad an outcome as you can think of for young people today - but they deny us opportunities and prosperity in the shorter term too.     The government makes misleading promises about the jobs that fracking will bring, but it's the transition to a zero-carbon society which will galvanise the economy and the labour market in a long term, sustainable way. And this is the work that young people want. But along with stuff like scrapping maintenance grants, cuts to housing benefits, and axing of tax credits, it seems that this government wants to make life as difficult as possible for anyone under 25 today. Renewables would offer some hope of a prosperous future for young people. Maybe it's not really a surprise that the government has crushed them.     Imagine if the government took the money it spends on war and fossil fuels and spent it on developing a vibrant renewable energy industry instead. At the moment they're doing the reverse. They're backing the interests of big oil and gas over the interests of young people.    We can fight back. We can bring the renewable energy revolution into the hands of real people and real communities. And it can start in the student movement. There's about £5billion invested in fossil fuels across our universities, and thousands of students are telling their institutions to stop fuelling climate breakdown - with some massive wins already. But we won't stop there. Over the next year, we'll be campaigning to invest that money back into the clean alternatives and give the sector the support it needs.     If our government won't champion renewables, we'll have to do it instead.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:15:16	Why I'd Deter Anyone From Becoming a Nurse	All nurses know that nursing involves sacrifice. We know that a lot will be sacrificed, from our lunch breaks to our bank balance to our lifestyle, we prepare ourselves for what we will have to give up. However, it's not the sacrifice that makes the job so frustrating, it's the compromise. Nurses are compromising so much that something's got to give. I think this disheartening truth is what has caused mental health problems amongst nurses to recently double, and now with the added pressure of our ex-pat colleagues potentially being forced to leave, more nurses may be leaving the profession.     My fundamental reason for becoming a nurse was to have a strong skill and trade. Nurses are encouraged to develop knowledge and skills throughout our careers. However, the opportunity for career development in reality is scant. Fewer nurses are being supported with grants for post-registration training. Places on those courses are diminishing and nurse managers are reluctant to lose team members on the ground. Private agency nurses are more likely to achieve promotion through work flexibility and are better able to afford course fees due to pay increases. Meanwhile permanent NHS nurses have had affective demotions through de-banding. I have worked with people who have been nurses longer than I have been alive, who have dedicated a lifetime to the NHS, but have been de-banded so they are on the same banding as me. Nurses have been expected to compromise their careers to work in the job they love.    Like many other nurses, I had recognised my own symptoms of depression and severe anxiety. I encountered a lack of understanding of mental health, which is surprisingly common in physical healthcare. The NHS is a system we all take for granted and I cannot begin to express its worth, or the worth of its employees. However, when faced with the all challenges it has had, the NHS struggles to provide the help nurses deserve, much less adequately address and support staff with chronic health problems. Nurses struggle, and their health suffers.    For myself and others, nursing in the UK meant working for the NHS. It was the NHS that trained me, and it was the NHS that paid my bursary as a student. Ten years ago, if you had told me I would be working in private healthcare I wouldn't have believed you. This is something I hear nurses and doctors say often in the private sector. For me, the shift to private was a career choice. I had wanted to work in Ophthalmology and my hospital had just built a brand new eye department in order to accommodate for the volume of patients. However, after 2008 and the 'reappraisal' of funding in the NHS, there had been a change in the criteria for approval of cataract surgery. Patients were now being told their vision was 'too good' for surgery, and our once busy eye department fell quiet. This reduction in NHS treatment was clearly good news for private healthcare companies, and with no jobs at my NHS hospital, I moved to a private eye hospital. With Moorfields now also moving to become an NHS 'mutual', it is likely that NHS Ophthalmology could be privatised on the same scale as NHS Dentistry, meaning fewer NHS jobs for nurses. Many nurses go private because they believe it will be a less stressful environment, or for a pay increase. For myself, and for others, the move is a compromise of values.    No nurse wants to discuss incidents of compromised patient care, but we all see them. The patient who was overlooked, the patient who got ripped off, the ward that was understaffed, the doctor who was sleep-deprived, the department that was under-stocked. Additionally, in the private health 'free market', de-regulation of practice is risking patient safety. Every day, nurses see patient care compromised because of circumstances beyond their control. Patient care, the very root of why they chose the profession, is taken away.    Many nurses are leaving the profession for other areas, but with government cuts to the charity sector as well, it can be disheartening for those of us looking for a vocation. I believe that nursing can be one of the most proud, satisfying and enjoyable careers, but with all the challenges facing the profession as it stands, it can also be demoralizing and dispiriting. So, if someone were to ask me if I thought nursing was a satisfying job, I would have to tell them no, not anymore.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:19:30	If I Wrote My Debut Novel Again, Here's What I'd Do Differently	In the same way that you'll only ever have one first kiss, you only get one shot at your debut novel. I mean, you'll redraft and edit it 10 million times, but you only do the whole process once. And it's about trial, error, heartbreak and pride.       I'm proud as punch of my debut, but when I came to write my second, I did a lot of stuff differently. So if you're currently wrestling with your first written kiss, maybe some of the lessons I learned could save you some time...    1. Use Scrivener     I'm not joking, I don't think I could have written my second without this piece of software. Not because it wrote it for me (that software does NOT exist) but because it enabled me to structure a tricky plot and move things around without messing everything up. So, if you possibly can, get Scrivener. It's not super cheap (around £35) but you can get a month's trial - I did - and that gives you a chance to see if it's for you. You can export anything you've written so you won't lose it at the end of the month. I feel like I'm flogging this a bit hard. This isn't a pyramid scheme. Promise.     2. Don't polish it, yet    You've all heard the expression "don't get it right, get it written"? Yeah. It's true. I spent ages (years) tweaking this and that, perfecting dialogue that all got cut when I did a massive rewrite on chunks of Try Not To Breathe (that's a normal thing to do, by the way).     When it came to my second, I just bashed it all out really quickly. I had the characters in my head and I knew the basic plot, so I just wanted to get it all down and see how it looked. It took about three months to write that first draft, unlike the years it took the first time.     3. Then polish it until it screams    Obviously you don't just leave your huge lump of stone unchiselled, Michelangelo!     Once you have the shape and the characters and something to work with, then you go through and edit ruthlessly - this is where you should spend your time. Whole scenes, characters and timelines could (and probably should) end up being cut.     If you can bear to leave a bit of time between finishing that first draft and editing, do. The fresher your eyes when you read through, the more you'll spot what needs changing. If you read and edit it too soon then you see what you intended to say, rather than what you did say.     I like to read through on my iPad's Kindle app before editing. I find it easier to do close reading and spot things, but I also find that I read it as a reader rather than as a writer.     I read through that first time, highlighting bits and making notes on the screen, then go through and do another draft in Schrivener that takes these into account. Then I export the whole manuscript into my usual word processor and start editing from the beginning. Like, a million more times. I'm still at this point with book two.     4. If it doubt, take it out    When editing Try Not To Breathe, I hung on to scenes I liked through several drafts, just because I liked them. That there is self-indulgent BS of the highest order.     No one wants to read a scene that doesn't deserve to be there - and no editor would leave it in anyway. I'm really lucky that my agent has an amazing editorial eye (she was an editor before an agent) so she wouldn't have let me get away with that anyway, even before it reached my editor.     Every word, line, paragraph and chapter should deserve to be there, if not, cut it.     As an aside, for comfort, I kept a Scrivener folder of deleted scenes so I could dip back in and rescue things if I wanted to. I rarely did.     5. I'd guard my writing time with my life    I wrote Try Not To Breathe while working full time and doing other silly vanity projects like an Open Uni degree (I'm a big fan of the OU but, for me, it was entirely a vanity thing) and destroying an allotment (all I did was weed and rotovate that thing).     I used to get up early to write, write at night, write on the train, take notes in between sets at the gym and so on. I'm proud that I managed to patch it together like this, but there were plenty of times when time I'd set aside was absorbed into other stuff. Stuff that didn't really matter. I'd take a day off work to write and half of it would go on doing laundry. Eff that, those clothes just get dirty again.     When it came to writing my second, I'd just had my youngest baby. I had to juggle things in a different way. My husband worked away a lot, so at night I'd put the kids to bed, feed the baby to sleep next to me and then write all night, pausing to feed him (and generally do one-finger typing while he fed as he fed for HOURS). I realised how much more I could immerse myself in what I was doing when I could dedicate hours of quiet time to it.     Time is a luxury. And, as I found with my first book, you can make any fragments of time work for you. But if you possibly can set aside chunks of writing time, do. And be strict, protect it and respect it. Your first kiss will be all the better for it.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:21:00	Reading Festival Review: From The Libertines To Foals, The Sets You Need To Watch On iPlayer (VIDEO)	Festival-goers enjoyed a huge variety of performances at Reading Festival over the weekend, when everyone from Azealia Banks and Kendrick Lamar, to The Libertines and Jamie T took to the stage.     With nine different stages each presenting 12 hours a day of music, seeing everything was impossible, so there’s only one thing left to do - watch all of the best bits on the BBC iPlayer.    MORE: In Pictures - Reading Festival 2015    But which sets are worth watching? And did any of this year’s acts give a performance that will go down in Festival history? Check out our top picks here…     1. The Libertines         It’s universally agreed (by everyone except Arcade Fire fans) that The Libertines should have headlined Reading & Leeds when they officially reunited in 2010. Cut to 2015, and with new album ‘Anthem For Doomed Youth’ on the way, Pete Doherty and Carl Barat were ready to rewrite their own Reading history, claiming the closing set they deserved all along.     Set highlights: New track ‘Gunga Din’, ‘Time For Heroes’ and every time Gary Powell inspired the biggest cheers. Watch their set here.     2. Jamie xx         An hour later than scheduled due to Tyler The Creator's absence, Jamie’s set provided the perfect Sunday evening vibes, and - as long-term fans expected - ‘In Colour’ translates perfectly to the stage, which the producer shared with a gigantic disco ball.     Set highlights: Closer ‘Loud Places’, preceded by a sped up ‘I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times). Relive it - or catch it for the first time - here.     3. alt-J         alt-J have never struggled to find their place on Reading’s stages, which is quite the achievement for an indie band who often feel inspired by Elizabethan rounds.     Set highlights: ‘Matilda’, ‘Breezeblocks’. Catch it here.     4. Jamie T         Festival staple Jamie T returned to the mainstage for 2015, after making his 2015 comeback with a secret set in the tiny Festival Republic tent. Jamie’s often discussed his anxiety, and it resulted in his previous break from releasing form music, but he’s never looked more comfortable than when at Richfield Avenue.     Set highlights: His encore, consisting of ‘Sticks And Stones’ and ‘Zombie’. See the set here.    5. Foals         I’m going to call it now: The next time Foals return to Reading, it will be to headline. The promo for their latest effort ‘ What Went Down’ was perfectly executed, with tapes containing the album dropped across Europe, in the hours after a tiny gig at London’s Village Underground, so a secret Reading set made perfect sense. With just half an hour to play with, Yannis Philippakis and the band didn’t mess about, showcasing their new slicker, confident approach.    Set highlights: ‘Mountain At My Gates’, which will surely become their new go-to closer, and ‘Spanish Sahara’. See Foals’ full performance here.     6. Drenge         Now a trio, grunge rockers Drenge managed to inspire mosh pits at the festival’s mainstage in the early afternoon, thanks to ‘We Can Do What We Want’ and the raucous ‘Bloodsports’.     Set highlights: Every single festival-goer being captivated by the new bassist. Check out their set (and the mosh pits) here.     Unlike with Glastonbury, just a selection of the best Reading sets are added - in full - to the iPlayer.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:24:19	Danny And The Human Zoo (Review)	This one-off drama saw national treasure Sir Lenny Henry turn his hand to scriptwriting for a fictionalised account of his rise to fame, that saw him go from from working-class teen in 1970s Dudley to national TV star.    We see "Danny", played by newcomer Kascion Franklin, being bullied at school and using comedy as a defence mechanism, a device that wins him friends - and admirers. It isn't long before Danny is hitting the working men's clubs, ending with a well-paid gig in Blackpool - as the black act in a show called the Musical Minstrel Cavalcade, which turns out to be just as racist as it sounds. Surprise! We see the unformed Danny quickly slide into depression, until his father Samson (played by Henry) gives him a piece of much-needed advice - after which Danny deliberately sabotaged his own career. And then it ended.    Danny And The Human Zoo was drama as therapy. Henry's battle with depression and his stay at The Priory has been much publicised. But what we had here was a whistle-stop tour through Henry's early years without any real examination. Apparently, this project started life as a four-part serial - and that's what this story really called for. I suspect that Henry found this difficult to write (according to the production notes, the script took three years to reach the screen) - in which case, why didn't the production company Red bring another writer on board? Henry could have written the pilot and a team of writers could have written the remaining episodes. Just an idea.    There was much to admire about this. Cecilia Noble gave a stand-out performance as Danny's formidable Jamaican mother Myrtle and Franklin also deserves praise for a charming debut, as does director Destiny Ekaragha, who was surely handed a poisoned chalice here.    Unfortunately, the script left a lot to be desired. With on-the-nose-dialogue and clichéd storytelling, it was at 90 minutes, overlong and lacked any real structure. The stilted pacing was only mildly diverted by classic soul anthems and rock standards.    Danny And The Human Zoo's super-saturated colour scheme brought to mind Channel Four's 2002 mini-series White Teeth, adapted from Zadie Smith's bestselling novel. Last year, the BBC announced a £2.1m "diversity fund" aimed at getting more black and ethnic minority faces on screen. Watching Danny And The Human Zoo, I couldn't help thinking, "There goes the diversity budget!".     No one drama can hope to be all things to all people, so it's more than a shame that Danny And The Human Zoo is likely to be the only black drama we see for many years. That is, until the BBC's charter comes up for renewal again.      www.bbc.co.uk 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Alice Charles	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alice-charles/danny-and-the-human-zoo-review_b_8071088.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment
Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:31:09	NBC and Neil Patrick Harris Need My Help? I Don't Think So	I recently finished a grueling but successful run of my solo-show-chat-show-spoof "Late with Lance!" at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I did 22 performances for an average of 30 audience members each day who "paid what they wanted" at the end of the show. By the end of the run I made about £680. Between travel, food, housing, PR, production and festival fee expenses, I spent about $7,000US. Basically, I lost about $6,000. But, I did receive glowing notices and created business connections with producers and promoters around the world.     Performers don't come to the largest Arts festival in the world to make money. Well, some do, but they are clueless. The majority of us come to hone our craft, network, be inspired, and take advantage of the global marketplace that is the Edinburgh Fringe. We hope our shows get picked up and move on to other theaters, tours and further development.     Not only is my a show a one-man show, but I am too. I did the majority of my own PR. I spent at least 2 hours a day flyering potential "punters" on the streets of Edinburgh. I was on panels. I did 18 blogs for The Public Reviews. I appeared in dozens of other shows from 11am to 2am. I was a marketing machine. Yet, I did not get reviews from a dozen of the biggest publications covering the Fringe. So I had to work extra hard to get noticed amongst the 3,000+ other shows happening during the month of August.     Imagine my surprise on the last day of the festival to receive an email from the marketing folks at NBC! I thought they were offering me an opportunity of a lifetime! And they were! They were offering me the opportunity to help them do the marketing for Neil Patrick Harris' new NBC show Best Time Ever.      Below is the email they sent me, requesting my help, because I am (according to a previous email from them) a "Broadway influencer"...    Hello Peter,    I hope this email finds you well! As a means of introduction, my name is Blair Laurie and I work on the marketing team for Best Time Ever With Neil Patrick Harris, a new TV show premiering on NBC this Fall.    I know my colleague Rachel Weiss reached out to you last year about helping us spread the word about Peter Pan LIVE! and we would love to ask if you could do the same for Best Time Ever. Given Neil Patrick Harris's connection to the theatre world, we think this show will definitely be of interest to the Broadway industry and Broadway fans.    Could you possibly post to your social media channels leading up to the premiere on September 15th? Ideally we'd be looking for posts in three stages: a pre-post between now and 9/8, a lead-in post between 9/9-9/14, and a day-of post on 9/15. But whatever you can do would be helpful!    Enclosed in the below link are all of the assets, but of course feel free to adapt in your own style:  https://www.dropbox.com/XXXXXXXXX    Please let me know what's possible! If you have any questions, I can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX.    Thanks!  Blair    More information on Best Time Ever:  http://www.nbc.com/best-time-ever-with-neil-patrick-harris  Spotco Blair Laurie | Marketing Account Executive  SPOTCO | spotnyc.com  114 W. 41st Street, 18th Floor | New York, NY 10036    I immediately responded with this...    Sure thing, Blair! Happy to help!    In exchange, since my following is slightly smaller than Neil Patrick Harris' and NBC, could you reach out to your social media followers and mention my "Late with Lance!" show on Monday, Sept 7 at the Arts Theatre in London? I would greatly appreciate it. The ideal mention roll out would be today, tomorrow, and every day leading up to the one-night only performance on Sept 7. I would love a full house cuz some industry is coming to see it cuz they missed it in the 5-star reviewed production at the Edinburgh Fringe.    Here are the deets: http://artstheatrewestend.co.uk/whats-on/late-with-lance/    Cheers!  Peter Michael Marino  www.LanceShow.com  www.petermmarino.com    I am looking forward to lending a hand in promoting Neil's show, and I hope that they return the favor. It's really all about supporting one another in our valiant attempts to share our art with the world. And NBC needs me! And so does Neil! And Broadway! How can I let them down?

Venice Biennale is without a doubt the most important event in the arts calendar. Every two years the good and the fine descend to La Serenissima early May for an intensive week of networking, catching up and art. However, Italy enjoys other biennials which are worth mentioning. The Chianciano Biennale, in the beautiful setting of Tuscany and a spa founded by the Etruscans over 2,500 years ago, is the perfect example of an ambitious project run by a small municipality of 7,000 inhabitants and the local institution, the Chianciano Art Museum. In its fourth edition, it has established itself as the must see event in September with the showcase of an art exhibition of a selection of 130 international artists from 40 different nations. Music is also important with the addition of concerts, choirs, performances, al fresco dance parties and flag dancers taking place from the 5th to the 13th of September.     Within such a cornucopia of talent, Igor Prokop, an artist born in Budapest, stands out with a presentation of highly-elaborate and colourful paintings strongly influenced by nature and corals. Prokop has exhibited in more than ten different countries from Mongolia to Polynesia, where he developed his interest, and concern, in the preservation of corals, from Tunisia to New York; his career spans for over 20 years. The exuberant unlimited beauty of his works makes you stop and immerse yourself in a sea of corals and marine life. Prokop's paintings are an invitation to experience this magic world that still exists if we don't continue to destroy it by greed and nonsense. He generously shares with the viewer the privilege of witnessing some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth with a palette of greens, blues, yellows and reds. Beauty beyond belief.         The last parrot in the jungle of Amazon by Igor Prokop. BGPP/Brass Glass Panel Painting. Courtesy the artist.    As Angela Di Bello, Director of the Agora Gallery in New York, says: Igor Prokop creates sumptuously colored images created with an unusual pairing of mixed media and acrylic on glass or canvas. These are incredibly energetic works, grasping our awareness and plunging us into a spectacular, glittering cosmos. The flesh and bone of each image is color and line, but applied by the artist in a nearly psychedelic arrangement in high fidelity. Radiant variations of canary and crimson attract our eye and spin us into cool, mysterious areas dominated by violet and cerulean, the integrity of each hue maintained by a crisp outline. Cryptic titles lend a clue to the meaning behind each work, yet Prokop desires that we experience his work on an individual basis. "I am presenting some fragments from the endless world and giving them to the spectators with love."    Prokop has kindly agreed to respond to the following questions:    1. Can you tell us why you decided to become an artist?    My family background has definitely destined me towards sciences (2 doctors, teacher).  I love Nature, have travelled a lot, from Mongolia to New Zealand. I studied Biology at college and the world I have seen during my travels has become very complicated. I started to discover the layers of the seen and experienced world. To reflect it I found one way: Art. The development of the world for me is a complicated, labyrinthine system. That is why I could not use continuous reduction in my artistic way as the more I got to know about the world the more layers it was showing. My slogan is the evidence of "the more is not less" (opposed to the opinions of " the less would have been more").    2. Which artists are your main influences and why?    I adore the Renaissance type of man.Up till now I have been enchanted by Leonardo, Michelangelo and the other great masters. Paul Klee's playfulness and intellect have been an example for me for a long time. Also, I like Rothko's philosophy i.e. the viewer should get really close to the picture, identify himself with it and be absorbed by the piece of art. Despite the dissimilarity of imagery I see the need for getting close in the case of my pictures. I consider the prehistoric cave paintings magnificent.    3. Destruction of nature by Mankind, specially Corals, are a constant theme in your works. Can you please let us know why?    The responsibility of mankind is enormous, of the individual's and of the society's equally! The Hubble telescope has made it possible for us to see into milliards of light years. The Earth is a part of this complex and amazing Universe. It is UNIQUE and inimitable with its animate and inanimate Nature! That is why we must consciously protect it with all our means! We should! Art could be a most powerful force with the power of the greatest mind to protect the Earth.     4. What is your major achievement so far?    2009. Honourable Mention / Chianciano  2011. Leonardo Prize, ex equo I/2. / Chianciano  2011. ECAC Award/ European Confederation of Art Critics Prize/ 1./ Drawings  2013.Special Mention for excellence, Chianciano  2015. London / ECAC AWARD /3.    5. What is your next project?    I am preparing for an exhibition in Berlin and would like to get to the Miami Art Fair. I will join the next climate conference on-line focusing on "Global Warmth" and would like to exhibit my Luxembourg "Nature" pictures (12 pcs) simultaneously in "Print" and Online format. I have already started painting the Water and Migration material for the following London exhibition and, finally, a China-Taiwan and European exhibition is being negotiated.

Designed to retain the friendly approachable style of the old logo while introducing a more modern and clean look the logo certainly ticks all the boxes.    It'll appear in three different forms across all of Google's products ranging from Android, to Chrome.    There's the classic Google, the four dots that'll be used for voice control and then finally the G which will appear in all its shortened forms.        If you fancy reading more about how Google came up with its new design there's a rather handy blog post which goes into eye-watering detail as to what prompted the design change.    While on the surface it might seem to be nothing more than a simple switchover to keep the logo in line with its new parent company Alphabet there are another of actually quite interesting reasons.    The first of which is data consumption. Turns out that Google's old logo wasn't very good for data consumption on low-bandwidth devices.     This new logo uses far less data to load so when you're Googling something it's only the answers that are going to be chomping away at your data allowance.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:39:18	This Is Not a Migrant Crisis, This Is a Refugee Crisis	Dear Mr Cameron,    This is not a migrant crisis, this is a refugee crisis.    You withdrew British support from the rescue efforts in the Mediterranean last year. Your message seemed to be "Let the refugees drown - it will discourage the others." What a dereliction of moral authority.     Our country is a safe and secure place for those fleeing war. Many of these conflicts were started or exacerbated by rich western countries. If we can't accept the consequences of our actions, we shouldn't have taken the action in the first place. In this case, the consequences of wars we have either started, fuelled or contributed to are more than a million refugees and the harrowing sight of innocent little bodies being washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean.     We should take our share of these refugees in with open arms. All of them. Instead you order more razor wire to keep them out.    Millions are on the move. War is not the only contributing factor - climate change is tightening its grip on the planet, and the industrialised west continues to burn fossil fuels while poorer countries pay the price. The UK has to play a significant part in alleviating the suffering.     The mass movement of civilians trying to escape death and destruction is our problem. Mr Cameron, you should be quite sure that this human tragedy is not going away, no matter how high you string the razor wire.    In Swansea, Welsh Greens have got together with Citizens UK to take 20 Syrian families seeking refuge. 20 families is not a lot to ask. In Newport, Greens are also asking for the city to take 20 Syrian families, and offers of practical help from residents are already coming in.    Whatever it takes, the Wales Green Party stands ready to support refugees in crisis.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:48:11	130,000 Sign Petition in Support of Strikers at the National Gallery	Over the holidays, many families may have considered a trip to the nation's best loved cultural institutions, amongst which London's National Gallery is traditionally high on the list. However, summer visitors may well have found their outing soured by one of the most protracted industrial actions ever taken against a cultural institution. With a skeletal staff in place, only 17 of the 66 rooms are open to the public, with 22 of the gallery "must see" collections unavailable to view due directly to the strike action.    Gallery staff have been in a long running dispute with the management since gallery shop steward and PCS (Public and Commercial Services Union) Representative, Candy Udwin, was suspended and later dismissed from work in January and May 2015 respectively, after voicing concerns around a privatisation deal that would see two thirds of gallery staff outsourced, and allegedly therefore breaching commercial confidentially.    The National Gallery's plans to outsource two thirds of its workforce to a private bidder confirms a worrying trend for public services to be given over to profit hungry companies. With notorious security firms G4S and CIS manoeuvring for lucrative contracts across a diverse range of sectors, gallery staff and the general public alike were growing increasingly concerned about the future of the nation's artistic heritage. On July 31st the gallery announced that it had awarded Swedish firm, Securitas, a 5 year contract worth £40 million, notwithstanding the unresolved situation regarding Candy Udwin and the resulting public relations issue.  The fact that Securitas had been involved in a case of espionage infiltrating civil society human rights campaigning groups on behalf of the Swiss-multi-national, Nestle, from as long ago as 2003, should ring alarm bells. This case was only closed 2 years ago and does not bolster confidence in the ability of Securitas to uphold human rights, including the freedom of assembly and association often linked to trade union rights.    The visitor services and security staff are the human face of the gallery, ensuring all 6 million annual visitors feel welcome and safe; the staff's passion for the fragile masterpieces they protect is well known and they take great care to engage patrons, illuminating some of the works' greatest secrets.    When I stood alongside them during the May Day demonstrations earlier this year, I felt sure the management would sit up and take notice of the calls for meaningful dialogue. Gallery bosses claim it is necessary to outsource the workers as the union wouldn't accommodate flexible working that has been made necessary by cuts in the government grant to the gallery. PCS, who are responsible for the 400 workers whose livelihoods are at stake, have attempted to engage the gallery's management in constructive talks for most of 2014 since the outsourcing plans were revealed, but the gallery have resisted at every opportunity. Even the welcome input from the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) in 2015 wasn't enough. In a welcome move forward, the union has finally managed to broker talks with Dr Finaldi, calling for him to intervene over the privatisation and to reinstate Candy Udwin. I hope these discussions can continue and this sorry state of affairs will come to a cordial conclusion.    The gallery has so far refused to reinstate Candy despite her premature dismissal on the eve of strike action being ruled unfair by an expert interim relief judge. An appeal hearing was due to take place but the gallery decided to move it back to the 22nd July, claiming that the inclusion of ex-Gallery Director and recently knighted, Sir Nicholas Penny compromised the neutrality of the hearing panel. We waited with bated breath only to hear that a technicality caused further delay. Following the hearing that eventually took place on 10-11th August, the decision by the Gallery was upheld and Sandy remains out of work. But the workers, who have now initiated an all-out strike are determined to get Sandy reinstated.    The dismissal of Candy promulgates the attitudinal shift towards union representatives who are now seen as a thorn in the side of large organisations and not the vital component of a heathy workforce they actually are. Witness the Conservative government's vicious Bill to limit collective action and we should be under no illusion that workers' rights are under sustained attack as part of an ideological drive to fragment a raft of public services making them more palatable for private companies looking to make a quick profit.    I marched with representatives from the PCS and gallery staff again in June at the 'End Austerity Now' demonstration in London, which saw 150,000 people from around the UK come together to express their disdain for the government's cuts to vital public services. The support the National Gallery staff received was reassuring, reminding us that the problems at the gallery are reflected across our entire public sector and that our voices are louder when we act together.    Just 5 days later, I went to the Houses of Parliament to hear Labour MP John McDonnell quiz Culture Minister Ed Vaizey on what part the Government could play in bringing this protracted dispute to a timely and cordial conclusion. Despite an impassioned, comprehensive contribution from John McDonnell, I was shocked to witness an evasive Mr Vaizey refusing to broker a meeting between union members and management. It would seem Vaizey is content to let this ongoing public relations disaster roll-on, putting the long term reputation of the gallery at considerable risk.     Public confidence, and indeed private support, is not best served when a large number of employees decide to down tools and mount picket lines on Britain's most famous public square. The fact that the striking workers use creative means to get their message across, making sunflowers for supporters to carry on marches and demonstrations, and garnering the support of top artists such as Turner Prize award winners Grayson Perry and Mark Wallinger, adds enormously to public sympathy for their cause as well as high media profile, and the popular anti-austerity Labour Party leadership candidate, Jeremy Corbyn, has also added his support.    With the new Chair of Trustees (daughter of banker Baron Jacob Rosthchild), Hannah Rothschild Gallery Director, Gabriele Finaldi now in place, the PCS hoped their tenure could begin with the support of all their staff. But as the case against Candy Udwin rolls on and on, one has to wonder what an earth Penny thought he was doing when he decided to take on one of the most respected unions in the country and then abandon the gallery to sort out his mess?    The low paid strikers will be holding a rally on Thursday 3rd September from 1-1.30pm outside the Gallery on Trafalgar Square to hand in a petition signed by over 130,000 people contesting the privitisation plans to Dr Finaldi and Ed Vaizey, Culture Minister. You can find out details of the rally and the workers Facebook page where you can make a donation here.    NB: In a response to a previous post I made Penny suggested that my memory was at fault for thinking I sat in front of a pre-Raphaelite painting at the National Gallery years ago.  In fact he didn't do his homework properly; the gallery hosted a temporary exhibition of Millais' famous painting of 'Ophelia' in 1987. Whilst I was not a teenager then this was nevertheless still my favourite painting, to be visited wherever it chanced to be exhibited. I would like to point out that I correctly remembered the painting and the gallery but not my age!

Speaking during a Labour leadership contest debate this afternoon, Ms Cooper accused her rival for the job of “letting people down” by not having a credible economic policy.    The Shadow Home Secretary said his plans would drive up inflation, leaving millions of ordinary families worse off.    Mr Corbyn, deemed to be the favourite in the leadership contest, hit back by claiming his ideas would benefit the economy and would deliver greater value for money than the Private Finance Initiatives used by New Labour.    Addressing the Islington North MP, Ms Cooper said: “Your proposal is like PFI on steroids to do quantitative easing for infrastructure.     “This is not a way in which you can genuinely fund infrastructure.”    The row came during a leadership debate hosted by Channel 4 News.    Presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy asked Ms Cooper what was “wrong with Corbynomics” – a economic model featuring a “National Investment Bank” to fund infrastructure projects.    Mr Corbyn has suggested funding for the Bank could come through “People’s Quantitative Easing” – essentially asking the Bank of England to print more money.     Ms Cooper said: “You’re going to push up inflation and end up with lot of families seeing their cost of living rise because you are being irresponsible with the money.     “You’ve got to be able to set out a serious alternative but it’s got to be credible.”    Mr Corbyn hit back by saying his plans would be better for the public purse than PFI, which has cost “six times the original investment in them.”    He added: “There is nothing wrong with using quantitative easing to stimulate growth.”    Ballots are already out in the leadership contest, with the result being announced at a special conference on September 12.

The original supermodel was temporarily removed from the house to be seen by medical professionals, after suffering an allergic reaction when she was stung by a bee.    READ MORE:  Axed 'CBB' Star Hints At Possible Show Return  Bobby Davro Announced As New Prime Minister (Sort Of...)    However, her departure was short-lived, and Janice has since made a full recovery and returned to the house - much to the chagrin of some members of the group, we’re sure.      Janice Dickinson    Since her arrival in ‘CBB’ on Friday night, Janice has rubbed a number of her housemates up the wrong way, including ‘Teen Mom’ Farrah Abraham and former adult film star, Jenna Jameson.    Things reached boiling point in Monday night’s episode, though, after producers reprimanded her, when she appeared to have spat in the direction of Austin Armacost, during an extremely heated argument.    When asked if she had anything to say to what was dubbed her “final warning”, Janice responded simply that she was “very sorry”.    Janice isn’t the first housemate to raise eyebrows with her conduct this year, though.    Fatman Scoop, best known for his track, ‘Be Faithful’, was previously warned by Big Brother about his potentially offensive language, after he repeatedly used the ‘n-word’ during a discussion with the rest of his housemates.    Tila Tequila, meanwhile, was outright removed by producers after less than 24 hours in the ‘CBB’ house, when producers became aware of an offensive “pro-Nazi” blog post she wrote, back in 2013.    ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ continues on Tuesday (1 September), at 10pm on Channel 5.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 14:09:56	'James Bond' Author Anthony Horowitz Apologises After Idris Elba 'Too Street' Remarks	‘James Bond’ author Anthony Horowitz has apologised for remarks he made about actor Idris Elba, suggesting the actor would be “too street” to play 007.    Anthony - who is currently at the helm of the ‘Bond’ book series, with his debut novel in the franchise hitting book shops next week - was met with accusations of racism for his comments, after he said: “For me Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part.       Idris Elba    "It’s not a colour issue. I think he is probably a bit too ‘street’ for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah.”    He has since tweeted a statement, apologising to those who were offended by his remarks.      Anthony Horowitz    “I’m really sorry my comments about Idris Elba have caused offence”, he wrote on Tuesday evening. “In the article I express the opinion that to my mind Adrian Lester would be a better choice but I’m a writer not a casting director so what do I know?     “Clumsily, I chose the word ‘street’ as Elba’s gritty portrayal of DCI John Luther was in my mind but I admit it was a poor choice of word. I am mortified to have caused offence.”    I'm really sorry my comments about Idris Elba have caused offence [full statement attached] pic.twitter.com/UD6ouA45Uv— Anthony Horowitz (@AnthonyHorowitz) September 1, 2015      In the past, Idris has made no secret of his desire to play James Bond, though earlier this year the 'Luther' star lamented he no longer believed it was a possibility.    Back In April he told a crowd at the British Film Institute in London: “If there was ever a chance of me getting Bond, it’s gone.  “Daniel Craig actually set the rumour off. About four years ago he said Idris Elba would be a great Bond and it started to creep. I blame Daniel.    Even though he now thinks he’ll never play the part, Idris hit back at claims he is not British enough for the role last year, insisting: “I was born here. I was born in England, born and raised.”          LIKE US ON FACEBOOK | FOLLOW US ON  TWITTER 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Daniel Welsh	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/01/idris-elba-james-bond-anthony-horowitz-apologises_n_8072558.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

MORE 'CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER':  10 ’CBB' Stars You've Probably Forgotten Did The Show  The 20 Best 'CBB' Moments Ever  Do You Remember These 'CBB' Winners?    The royal-worker-turned-media-personality will become a houseguest on the Channel 5 reality series, during a special live show tonight (1 September), taking part in the group’s shopping task.     The task will see the house's Brits turned into the Royal Family, while the American housemates wait on them hand and foot, which we're sure Janice Dickinson is going to simply love...      Paul Burrell    Speaking ahead of his entrance, Paul said: "I have met some of the world’s most important people - Kings and Queens, Presidents and First Ladies, movie stars and The Pope.  I wasn’t intimidated by them, so I won’t be intimidated by the people in the 'Big Brother' house."    Give it a couple of hours, Paul, and we'll see how "not intimidated" you are then.    He adds: "I know I’m not going to be liked by everyone because no-one is, but I’m not a quitter. I like a challenge. I love people. There are some great characters in this house and there are people who I wouldn’t normally meet in my life."    Paul, who was a footman for Queen Elizabeth II and later butler to Diana before her death in 1997, will stay in the compound over the next few days, teaching the group etiquette as they transform into the Royal Family.    It is the latest in a long-line of reality TV stints for Paul, most famously appearing on ‘I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!’ in 2004.     He’s also appeared as a judge and trainer on ‘Australian Princess’ in 2005, and the following year he appeared on both ‘Celebrity Stars In Their Eyes’ and ‘Trust Me - I’m A Holiday Rep’.     Paul also came under fire for publishing intimate details about Diana and the rest of the Royal Family in his 2003 memoirs, ‘A Royal Duty’.    ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 5.

Tue, 01 Sep 2015 20:54:25	Chuka Umunna Calls For Labour Colleagues To Work With Jeremy Corbyn Should He Win	“Work with Jeremy Corbyn… should he win.” That was the conciliatory message from Chuka Umunna to his Labour colleagues on Tuesday, an apparent olive branch from the modernisers to the Labour leadership frontrunner and his supporters.      In a speech to the Policy Network think-tank in the Netherlands, the shadow business secretary warned MPs disgruntled by Corbyn's impending victory that they must "support our new leader in developing an agenda that can return Labour to office,” adding that the party should accept the views of the new members, many who lean away from the Blairite past.        Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna    "Solidarity is key which is why we must accept the result of our contest when it comes and support our new leader in developing an agenda that can return Labour to office," he said.     Umanna, who has yet to say whether he will accept a post in a Corbyn-led shadow cabinet, said members can't "simply dismiss out of hand those who hold critical views of New Labour.” He added: “Like any government, the New Labour administration made mistakes -- it could and should have achieved more, and done more to challenge the right's assumptions about the world."    "In the end, it is not unreasonable to be ambitious for what your party in government can achieve in building greater equality, liberty, democracy and sustainability,” he said. "It is far better we acknowledge, not reject, this ambition for a better world, as we seek to forge a new politics of the common good fit for the future."    Bemoaning Labour’s central control, Umunna called for Arnie Graf, a former advisor to Barack Obama, to return to the party to corral the huge influx of new members. Ed Miliband returned Graf to Chicago in 2014.     "Some have joined in order to thwart the pursuit of Labour values but many more have joined to further the pursuit of those values, including lots of young people,” he said. “At a time when so many are walking away from centre left parties across the Western world and many young people do not vote let alone join a party, this is surely something to celebrate.”    Earlier, in a Channel 4 hustings, leadership rival Andy Burnham suggested Corbyn was an apologist for Vladimir Putin. Corbyn rejected the charge, despite having criticised Nato for not disbanding at the end of the Cold War.       Jeremy Corbyn, who recently came under fire for saying it was a 'tragedy' that Osama bin Laden was killed by the United States    At the same event, fellow rival Yvette Cooper called Corbyn’s economic plans a "private finance initiative on steroids.” On the issue of quantitative easing, she said: “This idea that you can just print money when the economy is growing in order to pay for infrastructure -- you are pushing up borrowing and inflation, and it has a big impact on the currency."     "We have to have an alternative but if it is not credible and it is not real, it falls apart between your fingers, and you are letting people down. It is the private finance initiative on steroids,” she added.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 02:47:07	'Great British Bake Off' Star Sue Perkins Reveals She's Been Living With A Brain Tumour For Eight Years	'Great British Bake Off' star Sue Perkins has revealed that she has been living with a brain tumour for eight years.     In an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine Perkins said that the growth on her pituitary gland will prevent her from having children.     The presenter first discovered the tumour when she underwent tests as part of BBC show, The Supersizers Eat.         Perkins told Good Housekeeping: "I was at a point where I was spending so much of my life doing TV that I only found out about my real life through a television procedure."     The 45-year-old said that the growth is benign, so it's "not a worrying thing", however, she said she was devastated when she learnt of the effect it would have on her reproductive hormones.     She said: “We live in a time and place where we think everything is possible. I don’t know if I would have gone on to have children. But as soon as someone says you can’t have something, you want it more than anything."     The condition, known as prolactinoma, isn't life-threatening. The major side effect is decreased levels of oestrogen in women and testosterone in men.     Perkins added: “Sometimes it’s big and makes me mad, and sometimes it’s small and is in the background.    "I have various tests now to make sure the side effects aren’t too onerous."    Perkins on Tuesday thanked her fans for their support on Twitter.    Ta for sweet tweets about my prolactinoma. It's benign & non-symptomatic. All fine,   Let's focus on those less fortunate in the world.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 03:03:14	Parliament Must Reject Assisted Dying, and Embrace Better End-of-Life Care	The lobby for assisted suicide has had many advantages on its side - not least money and celebrity backers. One thing it no longer has however, on a global level, is momentum.     Earlier this year, the Scottish Parliament voted down an assisted dying bill. Last year, the Welsh Assembly rejected a similar motion. Twenty-five attempts to introduce assisted suicide in U.S. States in the past year have been tried, and all have failed. In the most recent case last month, the Californian State Assembly saw the failure of Bill 'SB 128'. The proposal lost steam and was withdrawn in the face of opposition from Assembly Democrats, following public outcry.    SB 128 was based on the physician-assisted suicide statute that operates in Oregon, under which terminally ill patients can request to be provided with lethal drugs to take their own lives. This is the same legislation on which Rob Marris' assisted suicide Bill (to be debated in the House of Commons in a few weeks) is modelled.    Like the Marris proposals, the Californian legislation purports to be restricted to patients prognosed as having less than six months to live, and required two doctors to determine that they were mentally competent and had a "clear, settled, voluntary" wish to die. This shares the same pretence of "safeguards". As any end of life specialist will attest, prognoses of death at six months are impossible to make with anything remotely approaching certainty. As Dr Illora Finlay, Professor of Palliative Medicine and immediate former President of the Royal Society of Medicine, put it, 'the only honest answer' when asked about a patient's life expectancy at a possible distance of six months is 'I honestly can't tell.' Trusting people's lives to this sort of guesswork would inevitably lead to ill people's lives being ended prematurely, when (as has happened in innumerable cases) they could have lived full lives for years or even decades longer than expected.     Due to this and other flaws innate to any assisted suicide proposal, concerns were raised from the disabled community, and the elderly.  That is: those who are most vulnerable to medical discrimination and pressure to commit suicide. Groups such as Disability Rights California reported their concern that depression, incorrect prognoses, and the influence of unscrupulous relatives may lead people to end their lives who have serious disabilities but otherwise want to live.    For the same reasons, in the UK all the leading disability and elderly campaigning groups - Scope, Disability Rights UK, the British Geriatric Society, and others - oppose assisted suicide. As do the Royal Colleges of Physicians, General Practitioners and Surgeons, and the British Medical Association, which recently rejected motions to adopt a neutral position on this subject.    Liz Carr, the Silent Witness actor who has campaigned alongside other disabled people against assisted dying for years, puts it this way: "if the Assisted Dying Bill passes, some people's lives will be ended without their consent, through mistakes and abuse...Against a [NHS] backdrop of longer shifts, difficulty in obtaining appointments and the rationing of certain treatments, should we really be pushing further pressures onto our reluctant doctors?" Those campaigning seem to have no answers to these questions, or to the fact that a change in the law would put so, so many elderly, frail and disabled people in danger.     Like legislators abroad, many Parliamentarians recognise that assisted suicide (including the model proposed by Marris) poses a profound danger to the most vulnerable members of our society. The NHS has developed the best palliative care system in the world - though one which still needs significantly more support - and the Government must ensure that the best care and support is available in every area, to every person, so that the UK remains an exemplar of care and compassion to those most in need of it.     Doctors, disabled rights activists, and parliaments around the world have all rejected this step, embracing better end-of-life care. The UK Parliament must do the same.

READ MORE:  'BBC Breakfast' Host Drops C-Bomb Live On Air  Exasperated BBC Presenter Threw A 'Proper Strop' On BBC Breakfast  Bill Asks Carol About Her 'Tightly Packed Isobars', The Nation Cringes    The long-standing host has been with the broadcaster's early morning news programme for 15 years, but will step down from his role as the main male anchor in January 2016.      Bill Turnbull is leaving 'BBC Breakfast' and his co-stars are very sad about it    Bill revealed he had decided to leave in order to spend more time with both his wife Sarah and his "neglected bees”.    Speaking to The Mirror, Bill explained: "I agreed to come North for two years and it went so well I agreed to do another two years.    "That is coming to an end - by that time I will have been doing the show for nearly 15 years, which is more than enough for me and the audience.    "So it is a good time to call it a day and do something else. It was a long-term decision."    'Breakfast' moved to Salford, Manchester from its previous home at London's BBC Television Centre in 2012. Despite being based in the capital, Bill moved with the show.      Bill seen with former co-host Susanna Reid    He and his wife now plan to move to Suffolk, where he will be able to keep his beloved bees, which are currently on a farm in Buckinghamshire.     Bill added that having to get up at 3am everyday to present the show, had played a part in his decision to quit.     "You get hardened to it and I have done it thousands of times and it still never gets any easier," he explained.     "Doing that in combination with more than three hours of current affairs a day is tiring. There is no two ways about it."     Bill broke the news to viewers on Tuesday’s (1 September) edition of the ‘Breakfast’, telling his co-host Louise Minchin: “Certainly I am not looking forward to the last day because it will be a very emotional occasion.     “I am already trying to work out an anti-blubbing defence because that would be really awful to spill tears. But I know it will be a big day.”    His former co-star Susanna Reid quit the show last year to launch rival show 'Good Morning Britain' on ITV.    'BBC Breakfast' has continued to be more popular with viewers, attracting around 1.5m viewers daily, compared to GMB's 500,000.    'BBC Breakfast' airs daily from 6am on BBC One and BBC News.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:06:18	The Waugh Zone September 2, 2015	        The five things you need to know on Tuesday September 1, 2015...              1) PURDAH SQUAD    Government sources tell me there is ‘likely’ to be a new amendment to the EU referendum bill published today and it will indeed reinstate a 28-day ‘purdah’ period. There will however be exemptions for some ministerial actions and statements and it’s the precise nature of those that will be the real focus for Tory Eurosceptics.     Some in the FCO mutter that you can feed the backbench beast and it will always ask for more, but No.10 knows that Labour’s amendment this summer offered it a way through without junking all rights to ministerial flexibility. It’s worth noting that Harriet Harman got her way on this amendment, and some Labour MPs felt Hilary Benn was too ready to go along with Cameron and Hammond rather than exert a ‘Maastricht-style’ pressure of an alliance with Tory rebels. It’s that threat of a Maastricht alliance that appears to have forced the Government’s hand.    Europe minister David Lidington (pictured above), one of the great survivors in this Government (especially since he lost his main protector William Hague) knows more about Brussels and this terrain than most and his compromise plan may hold (despite a smaller Tory rebellion) if it satisfies Labour. The devil will be in the detail of the amendment.    Yesterday’s retreat by No.10 on the issue of a ‘Yes/No’ question being replaced by a ‘Remain/Leave’ question was welcomed by Eurosceps, but many Outers felt it was a sideshow compared to the possible impact of purdah suspension. We will now have ‘In’ and ‘Out’ campaigns rather than Yes/No campaigns. I’m told the In camp will launch formally in October, but it is waiting for all party leaders conference speeches (not least Corbyn’s) before making moves on who will lead it.    Boris was swift yesterday to say how ‘disappointed’ he was at Cameron’s apparent watering down of plans to get a full opt-out of employment rights. We could get even more Eurosceptic Bojo noises, not least given the latest ConHome survey (the Indy gives it big licks today) puts him in 5th place in the future leader stakes (down 5% to just 12%), way behind George Osborne on 33%.        2)   BACK/SACK CRACKS    Chuka Umunna has been on the Today programme following up his speech last night urging Labour to back whoever wins the leadership, including Jeremy Corbyn. With many shadow ministers now convinced Corbyn will win, their thoughts are turning to whether they will back him or plot to sack him before 2020. Some tell me they will stick with it, as the guarantors of the ‘mainstream’ on policy, and will battle hard in any policy reviews at conference. Others just despair and think the party has made its bed and has to lie in it for a couple of years until the polls become so bad that a new mood for change emerges.    Umunna appears to take the former approach. Asked if he’d serve in a Corbyn Shad Cab this morning, he pointed to a long list of Corbyn stances he had ‘great concerns’ about, from wooliness on EU and Nato membership, nationalisation plan and ‘QE for the people’. “I would find it difficult” to serve if those became party positions, Umunna said. But that’s the point: they may not become party positions. “It completely depends on the programme you’ve been asked to sign up to. It isn’t just about the leader”, he added, and said that ‘consensus’ was needed.    And on things like Trident, as I’ve pointed out before, its unlikely the trade unions (given their members jobs) would back scrapping the nuclear renewal. Ditto the EU and Nato. But if the new members stick around and join up properly, who knows? Umunna was keen to point out how much he welcomed the ‘wonderful’ new influx, though added ‘we can’t have a flashmob democracy’.    However, I note that Chuka also said that “ultimately we are all keen to contribute” but also  “you don’t only contribute by serving in a shadow cabinet”. If he were to decide he couldn’t continue, others may well follow suit.        3) HUNGARY FOR CHANGE    The sight of Syrian refugees in Budapest’s eastern train station last night chanting ‘Germany, Germany’ was quite something (though I’m not sure why they didn’t chant ‘Deutschland, Deutschland’). Newsnight last night pointed out that many of those heading to Germany in the recent influx were however Kosovans and Albanians, so the problem of sorting out nationality is going to prove a real headache for them and the overstretched ‘front line’ states like Hungary.    But Angela Merkel’s bold offer of 800,000 refugee places has clearly won her fans not just in Syria but among progressive parties and voters in Europe. Our HuffPost Germany editor has blogged on just how Merkel has responded to the new mood to counter the recent minority who have staged demonstrations against migrants in his country. (Some football stadiums this weekend actually had ‘Refugees Welcome’ banners on display - imagine that in the UK).    Yvette Cooper is the first UK politician to actually put a concrete number on how many Syrian refugees we should take and has won praise in several papers for her 10,000 offer (she even gets the splash in the Metro), with ten in every borough. But even that 10,000 pales compared to that 800,000 figure from Merkel and underscores her point that the rest of the EU just isn’t doing enough (Germany registered 3,500 in just one day recently).     The Times splashes on warnings from an ally of Merkel that Cameron’s reluctance to join a common effort could jeopardise his wider EU renegotiation. Stephan Mayer, home affairs spokesman for Merkel’s MPs told the paper: “If the British government is continuing to hold this position that Great Britain is out of the club in this big task in sharing the [migrant] burden, certainly this could do some harm to the bilateral British-German relationship, and certainly also to David Cameron’s ambitions to be successful in the renegotiation [of Britain’s EU relationship].”     And the Telegraph reports Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann is warning he wants more ‘solidarity’ from the UK or else our renegotiation could be in trouble. The biggest surprise was that Guy Verhofstadt stopped short on Today of going that far in linking the two issues.    I should point out that The European Commission is proposing more than mere 'quotas'. It is clear that while there is a right to asylum under the Geneva Convention, "people who do not have a right to stay in Europe, need to be sent back".  Its plan in May included moves to increase the rate of deportations of 'irregular migrants'. That's one to watch.      BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR...    Watch Jeremy Corbyn smile a feline smile directly to the camera at the end of the Channel 4 debate, as Yvette Cooper attacks his record of voting 500 times against his party. A priceless study of the self-confidence of a front-runner.        4) FREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER    For lots of parents, today is the day their kids go to Big School for the first time. And David Cameron and Nicky Morgan are determined to offer Free Schools as the answer to a severe shortage of places/choice at secondary level. The PM has vowed he ‘will not waver’ in his pledge to open 500 new Free Schools by 2020, with 18 extra bids confirmed today. A further 52 come on stream in the next few days.    The Guardian prefers to focus on the fact that Toby Young’s free school failed to get the green light for a new one in Oxford and a rival Swan School. What’s noticeable about the latest tranche is now many are being backed or helped by their local authority (including the Labour-run council in Oxford). A case of ‘if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em’? Still, there are some teething problems. One new Free School in Kingston is having to open as a series of portakabins - dubbed a ‘learning village’ by the local council - because its main building hasn’t been adapted in time for the start of school term.        5) VEST IS BEST    Some around Jeremy Corbyn are realising that his age could actually be a vote-winner, not least given the number of pensioners Labour lost at the last election. Literally a ‘greybeard’, complete with a vest and above pensionable age (he’s 66 folks), Corbyn has today written a piece for the Telegraph (noting its more elderly demographic perhaps), in which he says Britain needs a “flexible pension age” to allow people in physically demanding jobs to be able to retire and claim their pensions earlier.     This is a point made by many trade unions when Labour first came up with its retirement age consensus under Adair Turner - many in manual labour jobs simply can’t go on until 67 or 68 like others in office or retail posts.    Both Cooper and Burnham yesterday had a deliberate strategy to step up their attacks on Corbyn in the Channel 4 debate (Cooper on his QE policy, Burnham on making ‘excuses’ for Putin). The Tel reports claims - strongly denied by the chief whip’s aides - that she urged Burnham to tell his supporters not to give second preferences to Corbyn. The Sun has dug up a 1991 column by Corbyn in which he praised the 'courage' of Iraq war 'deserter' Vic Williams.    Meanwhile, last night Jezza released his new arts policy, with lots of luvvy endorsements. He also had a foreword from Frank Cotterell Boyce comparing the arts to the Premiership football clubs sucking the life out of the grass roots. If Corbyn were to repeat that himself, there’d be a story or two...                If you’re reading this on the web, sign-up HERE to get the WaughZone delivered to your inbox.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:12:36	It Is Labour's Old Guard, Not Corbynistas, Who Are Ignoring the Lessons of the General Election	'Labour lost because voters believed it was anti-austerity.'    That was the firm conclusion drawn by Labour's former policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas from the findings of an independent review he established to determine the cause of the party's defeat in May's general election.    Now armed with what he believes to be the inescapable reality of the public verdict and its inevitable consequences for Labour, Cruddas is to be found warning the party that any future departure from the austerity agenda would carry a high price.    The findings - or at least Cruddas's presentation of them - have predictably been leapt upon by Labour's desperate old guard, which foretells of pestilence and great floods should the party do what everyone now expects it to do and elects Jeremy Corbyn as leader.    The latest to pray in aid the Cruddas review is Tony Blair, who wrote at the weekend: 'Labour lost because it was considered anti-business and too left; because people feared Ed in Downing Street with SNP support; and because he didn't have a credible deficit reduction plan.'      But some of the inferences drawn by the usually clear-eyed Cruddas, and keenly amplified by the Blairites, are seriously fallacious. For example, the key finding around which his argument is constructed - and which, he asserts, requires the party to accept 'some hard truths' - is that which shows 58% of voters agreeing that 'We must live within our means, so cutting the deficit is the top priority.' This, Cruddas reasons, demonstrates that 'the Tories didn't win despite austerity; they won because of it'. He apparently concludes that it can only mean the public supports rapid and deep cuts to public spending as the means to eliminating the deficit.     But all of this assumes that there is no quicker or more efficient way to reduce the deficit - when, of course, a credible and coherent alternative does exist. That alternative is one which recognises austerity as the worst possible response to an economic crisis, and that increases in economic activity and levels of growth (and concomitant reductions in the deficit) are best achieved not through slashing and burning, but by maximising tax revenues through the revitalisation of the real economy, by investment, managing demand and making full employment the prime goal of economic policy, by averting any fall in real wages, and by protecting public services and defending the jobs of those who work in them.     While this alternative, which is nothing more radical than mainstream Keynesianism, increasingly attracts support throughout Europe and among institutions - the IMF and European Central Bank among them - hitherto hostile towards it (their change of heart was inevitable, given the failure of austerity politics everywhere), mainstream politicians in Britain, and most depressingly on the left, remain either oblivious to the evidence in its favour or too timid to articulate it. Labour's old guard would doubtless see it as a disastrous abandonment of the centre ground. They forget that once upon a time these arguments constituted that centre ground; it's just that the centre shot off to the right a long time ago.          It should be noted, too, that Cruddas considered only the views of voters in England and Wales on the austerity question. How can this do other than distort the findings? Labour was wiped out in Scotland, where anti-austerity sentiment runs deep. Cruddas assures us that findings from a separate poll of voters in Scotland will be released in due course. So be it. But perhaps he should have waited for the results of that poll before rushing to judgement and offering policy prescriptions based on incomplete data.    But even if Cruddas's interpretation were correct and voters have bought the austerity lie, it would hardly be a surprise. For years, and right throughout the 2015 election, they were assailed by politicians on all sides, backed by the media establishment, espousing the primacy of deficit reduction, telling them that everything else must be subordinated to that goal, and offering nothing in the way of an alternative strategy. Against that background, it's pretty amazing that as many as 42% of them challenged that consensus. Presented with counter-arguments, intelligible and confidently articulated, it's not difficult to see how that 42% might be transformed into a majority.    Cruddas displays further dubious reasoning when claiming that 'The idea of an anti-austerity alliance with the SNP is unacceptable to a majority of English and Welsh voters'. In support of this contention, he adduces the finding that 60% of those polled 'would be very concerned if the SNP were ever in government'. But hold on. Voters' feelings towards the politics of austerity and the politics of nationalism are surely two fundamentally different questions. Is it not perfectly possible for English and Welsh voters to simultaneously reject austerity while harbouring misgivings over a power grab by a party that wants to dissolve a 300-year union? Cruddas is plainly wrong to draw a straight line between the sentiments of pro-austerity and anti-Scottish-nationalism as if it were the most natural thing.     Cruddas's review does not testify to the popularity of austerity, less still provide an excuse for the failure by the Labour party leadership to advocate a clear and bold alternative. Those conservative elements within the party who seek to exploit the findings remain in denial of the reasons for defeat in May. It wasn't being 'too left-wing' that did for Labour; it was the belief that, so far as it was desirable to fight on the economy at all, the objective had to be one of aping the Tories on 'fiscal responsibility', for which read deficit reduction for its own sake.    Cleaving to that strategy will doom the party to perpetual opposition, failing as it does to understand that most voters are not instinctively pro-austerity, but that in the absence of a convincing alternative they will always opt for the authentic model rather than the slightly paler imitation.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:27:08	Why Volunteering Is One of the Best Things You Can Do for Your Future Career	When you're a student the summers seem long and are often the perfect way to earn some extra cash so you're not strapped next semester.     For the first two years of university I worked in a family run jewellers six days a week in my small hometown. It was great, my bosses were kind, and I earned lots of money which allowed me to do many things I otherwise couldn't have the following semester.     But in the summer of third year I was faced with different prospects.     I had started a job in another jewellers which was 16 hours working a Saturday and Sunday in my university city, I was paying a huge amount of rent for a tiny room in private accommodation and most of my friends had gone home for summer.     One night I felt so annoyed at my situation I sat trawling through options on the Guardian jobs list and Charity Job. I came across a voluntary role for ten weeks on a pilot programme with the charity Raleigh International. And the next day I just applied.    My application went through 30 minutes before the deadline and I had no expectations that anything would come of it. Five days later and still in the midst of my exams a call came asking me to go to London for an interview. Thirty days later I was on the flight headed to Nicaragua, still completely unsure of what to expect or how I ended up there.    This turned out to be one of my greatest opportunities.      The leadership, determination and creative skills I learned while I was away proved an invaluable asset to my CV. I faced daily challenges from the living conditions, to creating a successful project and dealing with difficulties in a team of eight people who I had only met twice before the trip.     By choosing to volunteer instead of work I earned so much more in terms of my own personal development and setting myself apart from other graduates when I finished my degree. I had shown I had the determination to go on my own to another country to work with people I didn't know, similar to what you would face in a paid job abroad.     This trip along with other charity work have really transformed the way I live as well as presenting me with many opportunities to travel, work abroad, and meet interesting people whom I never would have if I had turned them down in favour of my usual paid job.    There are many opportunities out there when it comes to volunteering, and often within your job industry. No matter how unsure, afraid or doubtful you feel about volunteering abroad it is something which will challenge and make you learn in a way that nothing else can.      Tips for volunteering abroad:    Go to the charity's website and read about what they do and who their team are. Make sure you are volunteering for a cause you believe in and an organisation you want to work for because that will be your main motivation when you're there.    Avoid "pay for play" organisations. There are many organisations who charge their volunteers to work for them. Fundraising gives you a far bigger sense of achievement, something else to put on your CV and doesn't leave you out of pocket.    Make sure you read the Foreign Office travel advice before accepting a volunteer position. Look into the injections, safety and security and entry requirements in particular. Don't accept a position which won't give you enough time to get all of the recommended injections. Make sure you're clued up on the local customs and security of the place you're going to.    Choose the right location. If you are really terrified of insects, don't go to Central America to stay with a host family, choose something more European based. Try pick a place that you have a genuine interest in.    Choose the right length of volunteering experience. Volunteering is tough, particularly if you're in a challenging and new environment. If you've never been away from home for any length of time, it may be better to choose a shorter volunteering trip and build up to a long one.    Find out if the company provides your insurance.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:29:12	The Media's Caricaturing of Jeremy Corbyn Should Concern Us All	Heard the latest crazy idea that Jeremy Corbyn has said he'd enforce upon day one of his ascension to premiership? That's right: he wants to force all women to wear burqas and chastity belts, to protect them from the ravages of the modern train commuting misogynists. He's also unveiled plans to make bankers dance naked through Trafalgar Square, make Karl Marx's birthday a public holiday, to put the Royal Family in a council house (or was that the Greens?) and then swiftly usher in the Antichrist so we can get on with the apocalypse.     As you may have noticed, the press have gotten a little carried away of late. It is enough now to suggest that you would talk to various members of the group in question (in the most recent case, female commuters) to see what they think would work (imagine a politician doing that!) for him to be branded as a medieval segregationist (and, bizarrely, a 'mansplainer' too!). Our media is now so keen for an attention-grabbing headline that all thought of balance, detail or nuance fly out of the window.    It's not just Corbyn being done an injustice either: it's his supporters too. Take the reporting of one of the latest Yougov poll that compared all the leadership contender's supporters with the general public on various policy issues as well as demographic and personal descriptions. Apparently doing away with such outdated notions as actually reading the whole report, commentators have instead leaped to the most sensationalist conclusions they can, with Corbynites being smeared as essentially lunatics dressed up as socialists (or is it the other way around?) They are, apparently, the 'most out of touch' of all the leadership bidders' supporters, as well as possibly the most unhinged too.    To start with, a considerably larger portion of Corbyn backers supporting things like more wealth distribution and nationalised rail than the general public is not the same thing as those supporters 'disagreeing with the public on almost everything'. It ignores four things; one group wanting something more than another group is not the same as them disagreeing, we have no idea how many 'don't knows' there were, the cherry picked questions were probably chosen to show the largest discrepancy and the other three's supporters were considerably out of sync with the general public too. It also ignores the considerable tradition of polling that shows that support for these policies and stances is much higher than that reported in the YouGov poll.    The headline from this very website screamed that: "Jeremy Corbyn's Backers Are Way More Likely To Think The World Is Run By A Secretive Elite", followed by a series of smaller headlines that generally reinforced the notion that everyone voting for him is some sort of tin-foil hat Trotskyist. Apart from the fact that in and of itself this is a fairly uninformative and vague statement (as is the 'I'm a dreamer' statement: what the hell does that mean really?), the article in question chose to ignore the fact that it was barely a quarter of his supporters that had actually agreed with it (28%), and that it was only twice as many as the general public (13%). Kendal's supporters weighed in at a mere 7%, so should they also take the view that the general public is as crazy as the general public is supposed to think Corbynites are? Not the best way to approach potential voters.    The reporting has also largely ignored other interesting nuggets to be found in the polling, probably because it mars the otherwise simple message of 'Corbynites are bonkers'. The polling also found that more people identified as either 'left wing/ left of centre' than 'right wing/right of centre' or indeed 'centre'. It also found that when it came to status (socioeconomic grouping, income bracket etc) Corbyn supporters were incredibly similar (almost identical) to the general public, whilst the other 3's supporters were somewhat different. Does all this outweigh the policy evidence? No, but it betrays a more complicated set of results than the headlines would have you believe.     Media sloppiness goes far beyond misinterpreted policy statements and abusing polling statistics. You'd also think Corbyn was some sort of Islington based reincarnation of Karl Marx, serving up Cold War Communism. Little is made of the fact that his economic views are not, despite what the hashtags would have us believe, from the 'hard left' at all, but are rather mainstream economics. Proposals that are derided as 'nonsense' and 'unworkable' have been being called for by leading academics for years, as well as being practised by major economies for decades.     Another caricature is the claim that he is reviving political issues from the past, as if this is somehow unusual in politics. Mark Twain once said that history may not repeat itself, but that it does sometimes rhyme. This is why those that speak of discarding the old notion of the Left of the Right are mistaken: these labels still exist in the political world because they are opposing sides of a debate that has not yet been settled.     What we are seeing here is history rhyming, not repeating. Yes, Corbyn is talking about issues and offering policies that Labour did in the 70's and the 80's, but in a newly imagined way that takes into account the time that has passed. Although they would love us to think they are offering modern and pragmatic approaches to the economy, the Conservatives are harking back to our Thatcherite past in a far more radical way than Corbyn is. Both are rhyming with past history, although only one is doing so in a way that seeks to progress us onto the next stanza. To criticise Corbyn for talking about things that were once talked about in another decade is to criticise him for doing politics.    I love a good conspiracy as much as the next leftie, but in this I actually think the truth is kind of scarier. The reason we're getting all these misleading headlines and dodgy reporting is because there is no room for nuance in mainstream journalism anymore (if indeed there ever was). Sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies once theorised that one cause of dislocation and unhappiness with modern life was because of the sheer weight of information that is available to us: no one of us can ever hope to shift through it all, let alone understand it. Nowhere is this more evident than the sensationalist (and misleading) headlines that now populate the twitterfeed or Facebook timeline. Every post is vying for attention and so one that presents a nuanced, thoughtful outlook will be ignored by the Twittersphere in favour of the bold proclamations, with accuracy and truth being relegated to mere secondary considerations. Throw in the fact that we seem to have the attention spans of a goldfish and you've got a potent brew of democratic disaster.    It is sometimes said that we get the government we deserve (not sure about this, we'd have to have done something pretty bad to be lumped with these guys) but it might be truer to say we get the media we deserve. As difficult as it can be in a digital age bombarding us with information at every turn, we simply have to start seeking truth if we want to find it. We need to start demanding more of our journalists and political news sites, punishing the sensationalists and reward the thoughtful, considered pieces. We need to demand more of ourselves too: we must take the time to appreciate multiple viewpoints and really consider the evidence before us if we are to be proper democratic citizens. Truth has at the best of times been an elusive creature in politics, but if we don't demand more of our media soon, it may be lost entirely.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:36:16	Is it Time for Proportional Representation?	Had proportional representation been the system used in this year's General Election, the political landscape in Westminster would look very different.    The first-past-the-post system left Ukip with only one seat in the Commons, even after gaining nearly 4 million votes nationally. Similarly, the Greens won only one seat with more than one million votes and the Liberal Democrats were also victims of first-past-the-post. Supporters of these parties in particular have called for electoral reform, with the Electoral Reform Society only growing in strength as more people become less represented by the current system.    Had proportional representation been installed before May, Ukip would have claimed 83 seats in the Commons, giving them considerable influence as the third largest party. But, first-past-the-post allows changes to constituency boundaries. Successive governments have changed boundaries to manipulate constituency results, particularly in marginal seats. Naturally, the process of boundary changes is impossible to find a neutral solution to, as all governing parties have been involved at some point.    With modern society fracturing the political landscape into many minor parties, the current system does not adequately represent the popularity of Ukip, the Greens or even the Liberal Democrats.     First-past-the-post loyalists would argue that the perceived unfairness of the current system is worth it for a stable government. Proportional representation does give some chance of instability, with the inevitability of coalition governments and the fairly common practise of minor parties exchanging their support for government subsidies for their party or cause. But, after first-past-the-post delivered a coalition government in 2010, it has become difficult for this argument against proportional representation to be made.     Over 7.3 million voters, who voted Ukip, Lib Dem or Green, feel their vote was either wasted or largely undervalued. According to a survey in The Independent, 60% of voters are now in favour of proportional representation following this year's General Election. Some voters of the major parties, who benefit the most from first-past-the-post, are also beginning to favour the introduction of proportional representation.     Labour, a bastion of the first-past-the-post system, could opt for the establishment of a proportional system if their own election results continue on the downwards spiral they have been on since 2010. But, for Ukip, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats, the situation is much more serious. They need it to thrive, have influence and, most importantly, survive on the political scene.    For the Labour Party, proportional representation may provide an electoral advantage in the future. Labour would find themselves in a much better place than the Conservatives to form a coalition government. After 2010, the Liberal Democrats would surely never go back after the 2015 election backlash and Ukip seem the only party that would be willing to work with the Tories in government. Labour would also have benefited from a proportional system in Scotland, where the SNP would have won only 25 seats, rather than the 50 they took.     Although the installation of proportional representation looks highly unlikely in the UK, if minor parties manage to continue their rise into future elections, some form of electoral reform could take place with overwhelming public support.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:45:21	Six Things I Learned From Six Years Working in Retail	Retail is an important industry which concentrates on customer experience and satisfaction 90% of the time. The other 10% is the hilarious/infuriating nonsense it's employees have to put up with on a daily basis.    During my time as a retail employee I encountered some truly passionate, motivated, hilarious people who made a career in retail exciting  and worthwhile. After recently quitting my position to work a temporary media-based job in London, however, I know the retail path is no longer the one I wish to tread.    I want to be clear when I say this is not a slur on the company I worked for, or on anyone who is currently working in retail - it's a reflection on my time working in the trade. My experience is pretty extensive, but I've reduced it down to 6 things I learned as a General Sales Assistant/Head Cashier/Professional doormat:    1. The customer is [NOT] always right    Anyone who works in retail will understand this. Usually, the customer is utterly, utterly wrong. There are a multitude of tales I could tell on this subject, but the recurring favourites include; customers telling me how much they think an item is worth, instead of reading the actual price tag, customer's telling me we 'definitely sell shower curtains' when we've never sold shower curtains, and the classic 'this was in the sale area' when we weren't even having  a sale.    'Am I being Punk'd?' consistently crossed my mind when customers behaved like this - then I realised these people were simply sent on a mission by Satan to slowly ruin my life.     2. The sound of your own voice is excruciatingly boring    'Hello there, sorry to keep you waiting today' - 'Do you have a membership card?' - 'Would you like a membership card?' 'Would you like your receipt in the bag?' - *customer makes inappropriate joke* - 'Haha! S'always the way!'    The above is a miniscule example of how mundane and boring my cashier conversations were.     My repetitive script did teach me one thing; never leave room for interpretation when speaking to customers, or use the word 'definitely'. Why? Because customers will definitely quote it back at you when the item they're definitely after definitely isn't in stock on the day they definitely turned up to definitely purchase said item. You will definitely regret it. Definitely.     (Complaints aside, my tannoy voice was exceptional, and I'll happily demonstrate it to anyone who asks).    3. People assume you're stupid because you're wearing a uniform    Instead of making you more visible to a customer, uniforms magically reduce your visibility. Customers seemed to love pushing past me, or simply ignoring my existence altogether. I always enjoyed it when a disgruntled customer loudly complained 'There's never anyone around to help in this shop!' as I stood next to them, in my uniform, repeatedly folding a table of t-shirts, trying not to implode with rage.     The classic 'Do you work here?' always went down well, too. I often wondered who was more stupid; the customer for asking the question, or me for dignifying it with the response of 'Yes'.    My managers were all over-worked, and often received unnecessary abuse from cranky customers. No member of the team was stupid; we were just overwhelmed by demand and some customers thought it was a crime against humanity that we weren't able to satisfy their awful, destructive, insatiable greed.     4. Christmas is [NOT] the most wonderful time of the year    Christmas begins in August - that is a retail FACT. The stock starts rolling in and the customers love it. Everyone goes mad - staff, managers, customers - even the pigeons in the car park. We all lose sight of what Christmas is truly about; quality time spent with loved ones. Long hours and a lack of flexibility also make you resent everyone who comes in to the shop on Boxing Day, too.    Also, wearing a cheerful, novelty jumper won't make you immune from being verbally abused by customers. I vividly recall wearing my red jumper with a Christmas pudding on, and crying to my Mum in the car park after a Saturday shift. A customer had accused me of worsening her heart condition by politely refusing to refund a top which hosted a red label clearly stating 'THIS ITEM IS NOT REFUNDABLE'. I was eventually told to authorise the refund, and the woman skipped out of the shop with more enthusiasm than the Grinch who stole Christmas.       5. You will share things on a twilight/night shift that you would never share during a day shift    When the customers leave, the shutters go down, and you settle in for a 12 hour night-shift; a new breed of retail worker emerges. You'll tell everyone your life story when the clock strikes 3am, and you'll find the words 'beautiful skirt' rib-achingly funny when you say them in an Irish accent, on repeat between 4am and 7am.     Night shifts ruined my sleeping patterns, but cemented my friendships with co-workers and managers.    6. 'Patience is a virtue' is something you will have to learn to live by if you are going to survive more than 10 seconds on a Saturday shift.     Have you ever tried to maintain the visual standards Head Office has insisted on whilst your store is full of impatient parents and screaming children who think every item of clothing is a football/something to hide under/something to wipe their face on? You don't understand the definition of 'mess' until you've seen the children's footwear section on a Saturday afternoon. Eating the glittery jelly-sandals would be more enjoyable than tidying them as small children dance around you, mocking your very existence.    Ultimately, after 6 years of raucously unsociable behaviour courtesy of the general public, the phrase 'retail therapy' has taken on a whole new meaning for me. I send my love and respect to all those who are still loving/loathing their current retail positions.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:46:24	Five Outstanding Interview Tips	For every great job there is always a face-to-face interview. Interviews can be nerve wrecking because of the unknown, which is perfectly normal. However, it is crucial that you give such opportunity your best in order to land that dream job because you only get one shot. I will give a few tricks I have used to impress interviewers.     Do Your Research: Needless to say you must do your research on the company of interest. What I have found to be very helpful is talking to someone who has already gone through a similar interview. I have used wiki jobs to search for potential questions to prepare accordingly and written a list of core competencies listed on the company's website. I then matched each competency with a situation where I have excelled. The better you prepare the less nervous you will be.    Know Your Interviewer: If the name of the interviewer is given to you, you can do some research on the interviewer. LinkedIn is good place to start because it has details of the professional career of the interviewer and it notifies the interviewer that you have looked at their profile. A proactive interviewer might then be interested in you and glance through your LinkedIn account (make sure your LinkedIn account is suitable, this may give you brownie points). Having some background on the interviewer makes the interview more interesting. I was once in an interview where I researched the interviewer. The funniest thing happened, I bumped into the interviewer in the shopping centre near the office 1 hour before my interview. I knew what kind of clients he had and his personal hobbies, so in the interview I could say something like "Oh John, I realised you worked on client XYZ that sounds interesting to me how was it for you". This will impress the interviewer because you went that extra mile. If you share similar hobbies that is even better. Use it as a tool to build the relationship during the interview. You are more likely to get the job if the interviewer feels s/he can relate with you.    The Gatekeepers: The gatekeepers are the people who we usually take for granted, people like security guards, cleaners and reception staff etc. It is very important you are polite to the gatekeepers on arrival to your interview. Especially receptionists because it is the right thing to do and interviewers tend get the opinion of you from gatekeepers (this could be the influencing factor to land that job or called back for the next interview). You could engage with the receptionist by starting off with "Wow, this is a really nice office how long have you guys been here?" Then you can follow on with "How long have you been working here?" This will show off some of the skills that employers seek for such as interpersonal and communication skills. dont forget the secretary.    The Small Things Matter: The more effort you put into the interview, the better you sell yourself. It is very easy to tell the interviewer that you are proactive or you have effective organisation skills or you have sound commercial awareness of the industry. Why not show them during the interview. I hear you ask, how can this be done? I once got to my interview early, at the office reception I picked up the newspaper on the table. I saw the interviewer approach from the corner of my eye, as he got closer I started nodding my head looking at the newspaper as if to say I was really getting into what I was reading. When the commercial awareness question came up during the interview, the interviewer mentioned I looked like I enjoyed reading the newspaper earlier on. I knew another candidate who brought a copy of his CV and letterhead reference from his past employers in a clear plastic wallet. This was the deciding factor that landed him the next interview, the interviewer saw proof that he was proactive and organised.     Follow Up E-mail: This is something I always do especially when the interviewer gives me a business card. I send an email the following day to say thank you for meeting with me. I also try to personalise it by writing something interesting we discussed in the interview, for example: "Thank you for enlightening me about company XYZ I never knew they did ABC as part of their business." A follow up email shows you're a good listener and you care about your prospects at their company. It will also make the interviewer feel good about you, which is very essential in any career and office. It is also a good way for the interviewer to remember you. In a situation where the interviewer does not give you a business card, a trick to remember is their email address is usually just their first name and last name. Mike Black could be mblack@companyabc.co.uk or mikeblack@companyabc.co.uk. Usually the initial email sent to you by the HR personnel should give you clearer direction on the company's email address'.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 04:52:21	How to Successfully Navigate Student Finance	With the new academic year immiment, for many young people, moving away for college or university is their first experience of living alone. Navigating this new found freedom, budgeting successfully and being in control financially can prove tricky.     Whilst schools and universities have got better in providing valuable financial education to young people as part of their school curriculum in recent years, there is still a massive gap. Many young people are unfortunately still leaving school without the necessary skills to be financially capable adults. Online resources like MoneySavingExpert  and the Government's Money Advice Service provide helpful tools and advice to help students and their parents manage their money more effectively.    it can be notoriously difficult to understand student finance. Changes in Government have led to many changes to student loan thresholds and repayment terms, before you even consider course costs. It can be hard to keep up with current processes, costs and entitlement, due to regional differences in how funding and course costs are allocated.       It's important to make sure that you're getting all the financial support and assistance that you're due. The student support system is very complicated, so it's important to make sure you're not missing out on anything you're entitled to. Student advisers within your university will be able to help ensure that you're applying for the benefits for your individual circumstances     It can be really complicated if you need to figure out what additional benefits - if any - you're entitled to. Most full-time students in further and higher education only qualify for means-tested benefits like housing benefit if they're parents or disabled. Part-time students aren't usually treated differently to those in full-time education, but there are exceptions.    Sometimes the most useful advice is also the least exciting: set a budget. Once you determine your expected income versus your expected expenditure, it's easy to plan for what's left - or seek help if there's going to be a shortfall.    If you're encountering any financial difficulties, seek guidance as soon as possible. It's usually easier to fix things the sooner you deal with them.    If you find your money is draining away too quickly, you could consider getting a job. There will be plenty of employers looking for workers to cover shifts in pubs, cafes and shops at the start of the new academic year.    For those at the other end, recently graduated but with student debt, it's important to speak to your bank or building society to let them know your new circumstances. In the USA, there's been growth in lower rate consolidation loans for student debt, and we may see similar solutions reach the market in the UK as student debt rises. For day to day expenses, many student current accounts are automatically transferred to a graduate account  but you must ensure that you choose an account that's best for your circumstances, particularly if you're struggling to find work and have overdrafts from studying. Speak to Money Advice Service  for tailored advice for your circumstances.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:13:03	Cancer Cure Could Lie In Wasp Venom Say Brazillian Researchers	The venom found in a wasp's sting could potentially be a life-saving cure for cancer sufferers, according to a new study from Brazil.        The key to this bold claim lies with a molecule known as Polybia-MP1 (MP1).    It is found in a particular species of wasp, Polybia paulista, native to Brazil and scientists have discovered its cancer-fighting properties in a research study.    MPI targets cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells alone, by focusing on the abnormal distribution of lipids around cancer cells.    Lipids, the building blocks of fat, along with basic protein molecules are key to maintaining the membrane around any cell, forming a contained area in which cellular reactions can take place in.    However, according to a paper published in Biophysical Journal, MPI attacks these lipids and causes "pores" or gaps to form within the membrane.    This allows all vital molecules required for cells to function properly to leak out, resulting in cancer cells dying.

"This research would take cancer treatment beyond our current options, according to Paul Beales another co-author of the study, from the University of Leeds in the UK.    "This could be useful in developing new combination therapies, where multiple drugs are used simultaneously to treat a cancer by attacking different parts of the cancer cells at the same time," he told Phys.org.    While the findings provide a much needed window into how cells interact with anti-cancerous molecules, experts have warned against getting too excited as the research still needs to be taken through clinical trials before it can be administered in hospitals.    Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Aine McCarthy, science information officer for Cancer Research UK said: "This early stage research increases our understanding of how the venom of the Brazilian wasp can kill cancer cells in the laboratory.    "But while these findings are exciting, much more work is needed in the lab and in clinical trials before we will know if drugs based on this research could benefit cancer patients."

In a statement to the Huffington Post, WHSmith said the leak happened due to a "bug" in the system. According to its records fewer that 40 people have been affected.     "It is a bug not a data breach. We believe that this has impacted fewer than 40 customers who left a message on the ‘Contact Us’ page where this bug was identified, that has resulted in some customers receiving e mails this morning that have been misdirected in error. I-subscribe have immediately taken down their ‘Contact Us’ online form which contains the identified bug, while this is resolved.  I-subscribe are contacting the customers concerned to apologise for this administrative processing error. We can confirm that this issue has not impacted or compromised any customer passwords or payment details and we apologise to the customers concerned.    Jono Read says the problem lies with the stores' magazine subscription service.     Unfortunate that every time someone emails @WHSmith about magazine subscriptions it's going to *everyone* on the database. Details too.— Jono Read (@jonoread) September 2, 2015      It is not yet clear if the breach is due to a hack or an IT glitch.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:19:22	A Group Of Student Lawyers From Bristol Has Overturned 95% Of DWP Decisions Against 200 People Declared 'Fit For Work'	A group of student lawyers in Bristol has overturned 95% of decisions made by the Department of Work and Pensions in relation to 200 people it deemed "fit for work".    The volunteers at the Bristol and Avon Law Centre have won £1m in compensation over the past two years after representing claimants who challenged the DWP's assertion they were able to work. The students, from the University of the West of England, represented their clients at benefit appearls in front of a judge and doctor.    Their 95% success rate is significantly higher than the national rate - which is 59%.     Andy King, welfare benefits adviser at the Law Centre, told The Lawyer: "Our students have provided much needed legal help to over 200 vulnerable individuals who wouldn’t know where to start in challenging the decision that they are fit for work.    "Due to the cuts in legal aid, we could only help a tiny fraction of that number without the law students. I am confident the law centre can build on the project’s success, helping a lot more people that cannot afford to pay for legal advice."    Earlier this week, it was revealed more than 2,600 people died within six weeks of being declared "fit for work".  Of those, 1,360 died after losing an appeal against the decision. Labour branded the figures a "wake-up call" for the Government, who has faced criticism for the way the assessment tests are carried out.      Iain Duncan Smith is facing calls for his resignation    A petition calling for Iain Duncan Smith, minister of the DWP, to resign has reached 86,000 signatures, after it emerged the department had fabricated case studies praising the government's welfare crackdown.    The UN recently announced the government would be investigated over human rights abuses caused by Duncan Smith's welfare reforms.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:20:53	Top Five Ways to Increase Your Cybersecurity	It's official - digitisation has taken over our lives. With there now being more mobile devices than humans on earth and even fridges and kettles being connected to the internet, it's sadly inevitable that malicious organisations will attempt to access our data.    Although the majority of hacks are aimed at businesses and large public bodies - just look at the hacks Ashley Madison and Carphone Warehouse have suffered this month alone - consumers need to step back and take stock of their cyber footprint.     With the amount of data we produce continuing to grow, below are five simple steps consumers can take to increase personal security.    1. Manage passwords  Astoundingly, despite all the expert warnings, the most commonly used password in the UK today is still "password". It does not take a genius hacker to crack that, so if you're sat at a machine which uses this password, the time has come to take the leap and change it. A hacker's first approach to cracking a password is probably going to be a dictionary attack, in which every word and common phrase in the English dictionary is tried repeatedly.     With that in mind, "London" or "data centre" are not passwords I would use and nor is "London data centre".  The more character sets there are and the longer the password, the more secure it is. So including numbers instead of vowels for example is a simple way to increase the strength of your passwords at home and in the office. Just make sure it's memorable - the worst thing you can do is write your passwords down on a post-it note next to the machine for anyone to use.    2. In-house privacy  The average household is now home to 7.4 internet devices - on a side note, you have to feel sorry for the guy with 0.4 of an iPhone. It's now quite common that sharing networks are established, and although this is fine in the family home it can be disastrous in more open settings.    Using a shared open network while commuting to work or in student accommodation can leave devices open to breaches from even the least experienced of hackers. It's therefore vital consumers alter their device settings to ensure their files aren't available to anyone on the same network.    3. Evaluate your digital footprint  As the connected world continues to evolve, so do consumer needs so it's unsurprising certain websites fall by the wayside. Social media goliaths such as Myspace and Bebo, although still live, have fallen to the likes of Twitter and Facebook. Our digital footprints can't be completely erased but leaving personal data on stagnant profiles is asking for trouble.    Consumers must analyse their digital footprints, taking stock of any sites which host secure information which they don't use anymore. So whether it's shutting down your old accounts or removing details from online retailers so your card details aren't stored unnecessarily, it's an important step to take.    4. Download security patches  Although often irritating to see pop up on your screen at seemingly the worst possible moment, software patch updates are vital for consumer security. Ignoring the latest updates leave people vulnerable to data breaches as hackers are always on the look out for new ways in to popular software. This is especially true for operating systems, as leaving an age old OS on your laptop which has reached end of life could end in disaster as any potential weakness won't be repaired, leaving consumers open to mass breaches. It's key consumers get in the habit of installing updates at the earliest possible opportunity to combat the issue.    5. Backup your data regularly  This may seem like common sense, especially from someone who works in the data centre industry, but backing up your data is key. Using encrypted backup services makes it increasingly difficult for hackers to do any harm, while ensuring you are not at risk of losing precious data.     Having your data stored on a physical hard drive as well as in the cloud, like the hybrid cloud services offered within the data centre industry, will further secure your music, photos and personal information. After all, if it's good enough for the likes of Netflix and Facebook then it's good enough for consumers too.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:23:23	The Long Road to Stimulating Tech Innovation in Africa	In recent years, innovation, entrepreneurship and private sector involvement has emerged as a favoured route out of poverty for many development organisations and funders. Its potential to reduce unemployment, tackle societal challenges and stimulate economic growth has sparked significant interest and investment.     The tech sector is amenable to this approach.  Start-ups can be born anywhere, requiring less infrastructure and expenditure than most industries to get off the ground.    Across Africa, a plethora of technology innovation hubs has arisen to support home-grown innovation. Imagine spaces with brightly coloured walls, techies and developers sprawled out on beanbags and post-it notes on the walls. These spaces provide aspiring entrepreneurs with access to state-of-the-art facilities, high-speed internet, events, mentorship and training. But the secret of their success lies in the collaborative environment and close-knit communities that they create. These nurturing conditions promote a rapid exchange of ideas, skills sharing and problem solving which allows serendipity to happen.    Unsurprisingly, these spaces have attracted significant attention.   Funders such as the World Bank and the Omidyar Network are supporting them, while tech companies and investors have flocked to the spaces in the hope of finding the next Facebook or Amazon.     But much of the hype has been tempered.  Few are willing to invest at the risky but crucial early stages and many seem surprised when hubs fail to deliver on their initial promise to achieve financial sustainability in their first few years. Investors have become disillusioned that the entrepreneurs they are supporting have not yet created vastly profitable businesses or impactful social change solutions.     But could it be that our expectations are unrealistic? Globally, 95% of small businesses fail in their first five years, many operating in much more favourable environments.    It is easy to forget that in most African countries the technology ecosystem is still in its infancy. While Kenya's 'Silicon Savannah' is ahead of the pack, countries like Liberia lack any formalised ICT training, let alone a thriving tech community.    For these ecosystems to flourish there is a need to build both hard tech skills and softer business skills. But that's not all. Regulatory frameworks are often inhibitive, while high data costs, language and literacy problems and a lack of simple payment mechanisms create barriers to market penetration. Meanwhile, unreliable and costly electricity and transport, slow internet and cumbersome bureaucracy all increase the cost of doing business. Under such conditions, it is hard to keep budding entrepreneurs motivated. With no immediate income and a lack of awareness about technology's far-reaching benefits, getting a tech start-up off the ground can be an uphill struggle.      There's also a need to bridge the gap between the tech community and other experts such as designers, development professionals, government officials and those working in the private sector to ensure that devised solutions really meet society's greatest needs.     One could be forgiven for thinking the situation is hopeless. But the ICT sector in Africa shows dizzying potential. In Nigeria, for instance, tech and telecommunications reportedly contribute almost 10% of the country's GDP. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, more than two thirds of people have access to a mobile phone and the market continues to grow. This provides an opportunity for people to access, share and create information at a lower cost, faster speed and greater scale than ever before.        But realising the potential of Africa's tech revolution requires a new approach. Crucially, all involved must recognise that establishing a sustainable and thriving technology innovation ecosystem takes time. Rather than a narrow focus on the number of start-ups created, stakeholders would do well to look at the strength of a hub and whether the tech community around it is growing and feels adequately supported and nurtured. Helping to grow a strong and resilient tech community is critical.    Achieving financial sustainability also remains a key challenge for hubs.  In the early years, they will inevitably require core funding from sympathetic and patient donors.    A joint hub fund established by the DOEN Foundation, Hivos and Indigo Trust is providing seed funding of €15, 000 to do this in places where the tech community is still in its infancy. The fund is enabling groups like SwahiliBox in Mombasa, Kenya, mHub in Malawi and Sensi in Sierra Leone to scope the sector and host start-up weekends, training sessions and gatherings to support this process. The fund also contributes to core overheads, giving teams the breathing space to establish strong partnerships, structure their teams and refine their operations.    For more developed tech communities, the joint hub fund provides funding to help hubs cover salaries and overheads, while also experimenting with more formalised mentorship and programmes which support entrepreneurs to build businesses or social organisations.      The fund is currently providing €75,000 to iSpace in Ghana, ActivSpaces in Cameroon, KINU in Tanzania and Hive Colab in Uganda.  It seeks to help hubs generate more income, attract investment and refine their programming so that it best supports their members.  At this stage of a hub's evolution, we can start to assess the number and quality of start-ups and social projects coming out of a space.      Yet if hubs are to succeed, they will eventually need to stand on their own two feet.  Already, many are generating income in creative ways, but it remains a difficult task.     The Co-Creation Hub in Nigeria provides a window into the future. In its first two years, it achieved financial sustainability through consultancy work and corporate services like training, community relations, business advice and corporate memberships. It has developed a strong pre-incubation and incubation programme involving ongoing mentorship and it is starting to pay dividends.     Wecyclers-a recycling business it's incubating, generated $140,000 in the first five months of 2015 alone! BudgIT - a project which uses infographics, social media and community monitoring to allow Nigerians to scrutinise the government budget - is their first graduate and has secured over $500,000 in grant funding. Donors are now able to start monitoring the social impact of its work.     Beyond the hype, burgeoning tech communities across the continent could shape their societies in transformative ways. For their true potential to be realised, it will require patience, long-term investment and tailored support but it's well worth the effort as the potential pay-off is huge.

In this particular example science is most definitely taking away any of the hope you might have had when you woke up this morning with a massive hangover.    A study by Dutch scientists at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology asked 789 students from Canada to answer some questions about their previous month's drinking.      We've all been there...    Asking the students how much they drank on average, what they ate and drank after and the timeframe within which this all happened.    They were then able to work out a rough Blood Alcohol Concentration for those that had a hangover and those that didn't.    What they found may not appear that remarkable on the surface - 79 per cent of those that claimed didn't get hangovers had a BAC below 10 per cent.    Meaning? Well, if you drink less then you're not going to get a hangover. Seems simple enough yes?    READ MORE:  These Terrifying Science Fiction Weapons Actually Exist  Physicists Prove Universe Is Just A Computer Simulation  Are Comedians Funny Because Their Brains Are Different?  Tractor Beams Are No Longer Science Fiction    What it actually shows is that many of the people you know who simply claim 'Oh I just don't get hangovers' actually don't get them not because they have some magical forcefield against that never-ending 'doomfest' we call a hangover, but actually because they just don't drink as much as they think they do.    Yup, water and food sadly don't appear to have much to do with how well protected you are. If you've drunk a LOT, then regardless, you're going to get a hangover and there's nothing in the 'verse that can stop it.    Of course, don't let that stop you having the bacon sandwich in the morning, if nothing else the psychological good it does is priceless.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:32:14	Up, Up and Away: Labour's Journey to Reclaim Social Mobility	Waking up at four in the morning to go to work washing down machinery all day might not sound like the ideal day's work, but for me, aged sixteen, it was brilliant. The people were funny, the atmosphere was light hearted, the work ethic was gruelling and the pay... not great. Now a decade onwards, twenty-six (or 30 something with an indy hair cut according to The Independent) and sat in the Tom Watson for Deputy Leader campaign office, I think back to where I was - and smile.     It's been quite a journey.    Going from a string of dead-end jobs straight after dropping out of college at sixteen to ending up working for one of the most high-profile campaigns in British politics, I feel proud of where I came from and thankful to those who have helped me along the way. It might sound cheesy but if you had told me all those years ago, a truant from Horley doing his first day's work in a plant hire yard in Godstone that this is where I'd end up ... I would've laughed and probably taken your drink order.    But this is the British Dream - to be socially mobile.    This is why I am a proud member of the Labour Party and why I support the Labour movement. Throughout history, it has helped people climb up the ladder and catch them should they fall off. From Sure Start Centres to universal education, from the Welfare State to the NHS, the labour movement has protected people from all walks of life, from cradle to grave. Hardie, Attlee, Bevan, Smith and dare I say it Blair and Brown. We, as members and supporters, stand on the shoulders of giants.     But we must not fixate upon past glories and must remember that the movement must move forward, and that it needs to update and renew both its message and its method.     We live in a digital globe, not an analogue island. New Labour is dead, long live new Labour.    That our once-strong movement can be pulled apart with words and phrases like "Blairite", "Red Tory", "Trot" and "loony left" seems completely baffling to me. We, as Tom Watson has said, are part of the same Labour movement and we all believe in the same values - the same Labour values - of fighting injustice, protecting the vulnerable and ensuring social mobility in our society. To achieve that, we must be united.    I stand beside Tom - and all those who call for unity in the fight against the real enemy, the Conservative's. When I worked for Tom as his intern just a year ago I saw him take on the most powerful figures within our society and lead the charge against some of the most heinous cover-ups in British political history. He has taken on the establishment and he has faced the wrath of the media owning elite and rather than be beaten and down-trodden he has become emboldened. I saw just how good he is at waging multiple campaigns' at once on an array of subject's from Fixed Odds Betting Terminals to extra-judicial killings in Waziristan.    He has inspired me in time I have had the pleasure of knowing him. He can develop campaigns from the ground up and fight against injustice like nobody else in modern British politics. His experience and his talent is what is needed within the Labour Party.    But it is not just experience that the Labour Party needs but his integrity. I voted for Tom because he brings that to every campaign he works on. He came from humble beginnings and now stands to be Deputy Leader for the largest party in the UK, now with an electorate of over 550,000. That came from hard work and ability, not family connection's or money. From Kidderminster to Westminster, from West Brom to Brewers Green, he has lived the British dream - he has been social mobile.     Now he must fight to secure that dream so others can climb the ladder after him from where they are to where they want to be.    The British Dream is different to the American Dream. It is not the bipolar model of rags-to-riches fortune but instead it is something far more organic and simple. The British Dream is that we all have the chance to get where we want, no matter where that is, with hard work and effort. It is humbler, more rewarding, more British you might say.    Some want to just own their own home on a nice suburban street in the catchment area of the right school for their kids. Some just want a North London flat with a rewarding job. Others might opt for the freedom to live the good life - to work hard, and retire comfortably. But what is important is the freedom of choice in what we pursue.    But our dreams are under threat. Cameron's Conservatives want to break the middle rungs of the ladder whilst unstitching the safety net from under our feet. He has no interest in removing unfair tuition fees, expanding good education or helping those at the bottom rise up above their station. His interest lies in maintaining tax havens for the rich, destroying public services and making sure that his friends who run the banks aren't unduly bothered by those pesky regulators. As a Labour movement, we must stand united against these Tory attacks and campaign for the preservation of our British Dream - of social mobility in Britain.    Without the help of the last Labour Government, I would never have gone to college to do an Access to Higher Education Diploma with funding that is now no longer available. It was one of the first things to fall under the Con-Dem coalition knife.    The college doesn't even provide the course anymore.    If the Labour Party is ever to recapture the imagination of the country, we must first capture the dreams of the British people. We must make the British Dream our own again and become the party of social mobility. Only then can we say we are the party of those who want to get on in life.    In this country, after centuries of struggle and strife, we the Labour movement finally created social mobility - the realisation and entrenchment of the British dream.    Now it is our duty to protect it. 	UK Universities 	Adam Allnutt	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/adam-allnutt/social-mobility_b_8072862.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-universities-education

READ MORE:  'Loose Women' 'Legends' To Launch Rival Panel Show?  JSP Blasted For Comments About Prince George  The 'Loose Women' Have Just Skinny Shamed Cheryl, And Twitter Isn't Happy    The online vote sparked a huge backlash on Tuesday (1 September), when the panel discussed comments made by The Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde, after she said that she blames herself for being sexually assaulted when she was 21.       'Loose Women' bosses have apologised for the poll    Viewers took to Twitter in their droves to criticise the poll, while two rape charities also branded it “ill-considered, insensitive and insulting”.     A spokesperson for Rape Crisis told HuffPost UK: “This poll is completely inappropriate and Rape Crisis is disappointed that 'Loose Women' thought otherwise even for a moment.    “A programme like ‘Loose Women’ could choose to use its high profile to raise awareness and understanding of rape, its impacts and prevalence, and to support and encourage survivors to seek services like those Rape Crisis offers; instead, they’ve reinforced myths and stereotypes with this ill-considered, insensitive and insulting poll.”      The offending poll was also promoted on Twitter    Despite HuffPost UK’s calls for show bosses to comment yesterday, a spokesperson later told The Guardian they were sorry for the way the poll was worded, explaining: “‘Loose Women’ is a daily talk show centred around topical debate and this discussion, linked to a recent news story, involved a full and frank range of views from the panellists.    “We always want to know what our viewers think about topical issues, however, we accept that the wording of the online poll was misjudged and we apologise for any offence caused.”    It is not the first time ‘Loose Women’ has sparked controversy while addressing the topic of rape.    Last year, Judy Finnigan prompted a backlash when she appeared to defend convicted rapist Ched Evans, stating she believed he should be allowed to resume his career as a professional footballer.    The presenter was involved in a discussion with her fellow panellists, when she described the attack on a 19-year-old girl as “non-violent”.    "He's served his time. The rape and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape - but the rape was not violent,” Judy stated. “He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person.    "'It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink,” Judy said. “And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time.    "Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job? Again, even though he has already been punished?"

I know that's a rarity - normally a thought barely has time to travel from my brain to my fingers before it's there on my timeline - but this was dark. This had the potential to traumatise and to trigger but also to trivialise. It was a picture of a dead child, drowned on his way to what he thought would be a better life.    I'm normally dead against posting such guilt-inducing things on social media. I hide things in my news feed that upset me, like maltreated puppies or teen suicide victims. Why? Because I can't process the amount of emotion they provoke, so I coolly shut it off and scroll on. I don't feel that Facebook is the place for haranguing people with child abuse as they're eating breakfast. There is so much that is so bad in the world that no-one could possibly deal with it all. So, we tend to choose to deal with none of it. It's compassion overkill.     But there was something about this petition that compelled me to share it. Something about that child, so normal in his football pants, that needed to be seen. That couldn't be shut off anymore. Because there is a real crisis emerging not far from here and the people dying are real people, not "illegals" or "migrants" but  just people who were living in a civilised country five years ago. That's why the petition needed to be seen. Who knows what it will achieve, if anything. Will Theresa May care any more about those lives than her Tory colleagues care about disabled people's lives? Possibly not. But it has made so many people wonder what we can do to help. It's galvanised people in a way I've rarely seen before - in a world stuffed full of charitable causes, it seems there is still space for this one. And that makes me hopeful that we haven't lost our compassion after all, that there's still hope for humanity.    Then I read something else. Another thing I always swear not to do - delve into the comments section of a news article. It was a strange article, linking our old friend Theresa to the growing "Migrant Crisis" via her comments on EU migration. Last time I looked, Syria wasn't in the EU but geography has never been my strong point. The article went on to say that the EU was meeting in two weeks to discuss the crisis and try to decide what to do with all these people in Calais, Budapest and halfway across the Med.    First comment expressed disgust that the meeting was two weeks away. I wholeheartedly agreed. How many more boats could capsize in that time? But then our views diverged. He said two weeks was too long because "how many more economic migrants are going to get in over that time!" (sic).     How many what, exactly? Economic migrants? Those people fleeing war are economic migrants? Like a Polish plumber or an Australian student looking for bar work in their gap year?  Yes, according to these commenters, all migrants are pretty much the same. And we should be concerned, not that they might die in two weeks but that they might not die and instead make their way into this country? What are you talking about? How is this the issue? Were you given a soul at birth, or is there just a convenient cupholder there instead?    It got worse. "Just fed up with these migrants and their sob stories". "They are not refugees - they are Jihadfugees". "So if I make a citizens arrest, of an Illegal Immigrant Invader Occupier, to what Detention Centre do I deliver him to?"    And this genius masterplan: "There is only one element that will slow down if not stop the movement of these masses heading for Europe and that is WINTER. Forget about our useless PM and others, there is nothing like three foot of snow to deter wood-be travellers" (sic)    300 comments and each one the same. Trumpeting a retreat from the EU and voting UKIP as the twin saviours of this country. Pulling up the drawbridge, Staying British. Christian prayers in schools and St George and all that guff (where was St George from, again? Someone remind me..?).     Where was the compassion?     Nowhere. And once we lose that empathy, what are we? They say Britain is getting full, but I'd rather live in a full country than an empty country populated by empty people. This is not an immigration issue. This is a humanitarian disaster and if you can't see that, you may be missing what makes you human. You may refer to the refugees as vermin or subhumans but I don't think it's them that deserve to be demoted like that. It's the people who can't seem to find even a little compassion in the face of a crisis.    I don't have the solution to the Middle East. I don't think it ever will be solved - it's the birthplace of the Bible, and what does the Bible say if not that man will always fight against man? I don't have the solution to the "immigration problem" but I do know that it's been wildly exaggerated, and that the number of refugees coming here is a fraction of the number going to places like Germany. I know that the economic migrants so disdained by UKIP lovers tend to put more into the economy than they take out. But these are all arguments that can wait until this moment has passed.    Right now, it's about a dead child. One of many. And whether we as a country actually take one look at this and keep on scrolling. Or not. What will it be, UK?

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 05:53:18	Zero-Hours Contracts Up By 120,000 In Just 12 Months, New Figures Reveal	Britain’s zero hours workforce increased by almost 20 per cent in the last year, according to figures released today.    The Office of National Statistics revealed 744,000 workers were on zero-hour contracts in the three months to June, compared with 624,000 over the same period in 2014.    Women and students are most likely to be on zero-hour contracts, and 40 per cent of all those with no guaranteed hours would like more work.    The Government today claimed the working arrangement benefit workers juggling family responsibilities and education, while the ONS suggested Labour's high profile campaign against zero-hours employment may have led more people to recognise they were on the contracts.    Right wing think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs dismissed the findings as "neither surprising nor important".    Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna today said: “These stark figures show that the Tories are the party of insecurity at work.       “Ministers are watering down vital protections at work and have refused to act to protect workers on zero-hours contracts.     "As long as ministers are happy to sit aside and encourage the proliferation of insecure work, more and more people won’t have the security of knowing where their next pay cheque is coming from or being able to plan ahead.”      Ed Miliband focused on zero-hours contracts during the General Election campaign    Zero-hours contracts were one of the key tenants of Labour’s General Election campaign, with then-leader Ed Miliband describing them as an "epidemic".    If elected Prime Minister, Mr Miliband would have changed the law to ensure that anyone working 12 weeks of regular hours would be entitled to a regular contract.     In its statistics release today, the ONS suggests Mr Miliband’s campaign may have caused an increase in the figures.    The ONS website states: “The number of people saying they are employed on ‘zero-hours contracts’ depends on whether or not they recognise this term. It is not possible to say how much of the increase between 2014 and 2015 is due to greater recognition rather than new contracts.”    TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said the rise in the contracts showed Britain’s two-tiered workforce.    She said: “People employed on these contracts earn £300 a week less, on average, than workers in secure jobs.    “I challenge any minister or business leader to survive on a low-paid zero-hours contract job, not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will have.    “Try telling zero-hours workers who have been turned down by mortgage lenders and landlords that they are getting a good deal.    “We need a stronger and fairer recovery that works for everyone, not one that forces people to survive off scraps of work.”    Steve Turner, from Britain's biggest union Unite, called the figures "the tip of an insecure iceberg".    He said: "Companies like Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct are basing their whole business model on the use of low paid zero hours contracts with people not knowing from one week to the next whether they will have work.    "This shameful business model and rise of insecure work across the economy is taking us back to the Victorian era and should have no place in 21st century Britain."    According to the ONS, on average, someone on a zero-hours contract usually works 25 hours a week.    They are also more likely to be aged under 25 or 65 and over.    James Sproule, Director of Policy at the Institute of Directors, defended zero-hours contracts, claiming they "protected the UK from double-digit rates of unemployment" during the economic downturn.    The Institute of Economic Affairs' Mark Littlewood also praised the employment practice, and said: “The rise of zero-hours contracts is neither surprising nor important.     "Far from being a result of unscrupulous employers trying to exploit their staff, today’s reported increase illustrates the flexible nature of the UK’s labour market. "     A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: “Zero hours contracts have a part to play in a modern, flexible labour market. For workers such as students and those with caring responsibilities they provide a pathway to employment, particularly when the individual cannot commit to regular hours.     “However we have acted to ban the use of exclusivity clauses in these contracts which prevent people from boosting their income when they have no guarantee of work. This is giving working people the freedom to take other work opportunities and more control over their work hours and income.” 	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Owen Bennett	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/02/zero-hours-contracts-labour-government_n_8075496.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 06:10:47	Just a 'Minor' Crime: How Government Cuts Will (Deliberately?) Corrode Public Confidence In British Policing	Police chiefs have recently warned that as many as 22,000 police officers will be lost under proposed government cuts. This will unquestionably widen the chasm that exists between rank and file officers and Home Secretary Theresa May. Here Chris Hobbs looks at how police dealt with one 'minor' crime and how this could become the norm in the near future leading to a loss of public confidence in British policing.       It would of course be all too easy for hostile elements within the press to turn the following into a diatribe against police which is why I'm not naming the force, for whom I have the highest regard, although representations (not complaints) are being made.    The two victims, on parking their vehicle, secreted their laptops out of sight before leaving the vehicle in question, unaware that they had been observed. Whilst they were away, a  vagrant, who had been watching, smashed his way into the car with a brick and stole the laptops.     The suspect was;    a) Seen and named by a nearby car park attendant who knew him well and said he lived rough nearby.    b) The incident was recorded by a member of the public on his mobile phone.  He was sitting in a vehicle parked behind that of the victims. There was a clear view of the suspect's face as he decamped carrying the computers.     c) There is good CCTV coverage in the area.    The victims, who returned to their car a short time later, telephoned 999 expecting a prompt response as the information was such that the suspect was almost certainly nearby. Even if no unit was immediately available they felt that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation.     They were told that no officer would be attending and were merely provided with a crime book number. They did speak later to a Scenes of Crimes Officer over the phone who concluded that as there was no blood apparent, he would not attend. The fact that the suspect was a vagrant and had plenty of contact in the back of the vehicle, would suggest that there was some realistic possibility of fingerprint evidence to support the identification.     To add insult to injury, the victims flagged down a passing police vehicle only to be informed that the occupants were British Transport Police officers and couldn't assist. In fairness they could well have been told that the matter had already been reported to the police force in question.     The victims, who were desperate to recover their laptops, could be forgiven for believing that the BTP officers could have done a quick tour of the area to look for the suspect making his way to the nearest second hand shop or local 'fence.'. Doubtless that BTP officers would have been concerned that dealing with a call which the 'jurisdictional' force had declined to attend could be politically problematic although that will be of little consolation to the luckless victims.     The force in question is being savagely cut and has admitted its standards of service will suffer. It could well be that the refusal to attend motor vehicle crimes, even where a suspect is in the vicinity, is part of force policy. It could perhaps be that the police operators, and the victims made three calls, didn't fully appreciate that the suspect would have been close by.     What is perhaps concerning is that, if this is the standard of service forced on police forces by the level of government cutbacks, how will this adversely affect the public view of police? There has of course been intense speculation, some (but not all) of it wildly distorted, as to how police will treat future victims of burglary as the cuts bite even deeper.     At present, despite the bile healed on police by the press and politicians especially Home Secretary Theresa May,  satisfaction remains constant at between 60% and 70% which is more than three times that of both politicians and journalists.  With no section of the national press willing to fight the corner of police in respect of the devastating effect of cuts it will, in any event, be difficult for police forces to maintain the public levels of satisfaction that are so crucial.    It could, of course, be that some police forces are pre-empting future cuts by introducing policies that, in effect, illustrate the reduced level of services the public can expect. This may be with a view to instigating a public debate on the issue; a debate that has been sadly lacking thus far despite the efforts of local police federations. Forces may also be attempting to demonstrate to the government and a reviled Home Secretary that matters are becoming desperate.     If the government are attempting to drive a wedge between the police and the public, it could hardly be doing a better job. Police have two factors in their favour; that the public see for themselves on the streets the challenges faced by police while the plethora of fly on the wall police documentaries, also convey the difficulties encountered by front line officers including extreme violence and intimidation.     Those who are the above mentioned victims in this particular case hope to ascertain how the relevant force policy was applied to their particular crime. They are also in possession of the relevant footage which clearly shows the suspects face after his hoodie slips.     This relatively minor crime and its unsatisfactory outcome, when multiplied thousands and thousands of times across the UK will unquestionably and, perhaps deliberately, drive a wedge between police and public thereby paving the way for increasing privatisation.      Perhaps it is pure coincidence that police whistleblower James Patrick's book 'The Rest is Silence'  provides compelling evidence that architects of so called police reform, from which these cuts emanate, have their fingers in the lucrative private security pie.    Sadly, as the cuts bite and more issues of this nature emerge, they will provide a feeding frenzy for the national press who seem, almost as one, to have decided that the UK police service needs to be 'put in its place.'      Meanwhile two victims of crime who were fervently 'pro- police' are now perhaps just a little less so.     Originally published in Guerrilla Wire magazine.

First it was Dirty Den, and then it was Kathy Beale. And now… it’s Wellard the Dog.    Well, kind of.    READ MORE:  'EastEnders' Actress Discusses Emotional Stillbirth Storyline  'EastEnders' Spoiler! Has Sharon's Dad Been Revealed?    Earlier this year, Dean Gaffney was confirmed to be returning to the BBC soap for a brief stint as Robbie Jackson, but it’s now been revealed that he’ll be bringing Wellard back with him.      Robbie and Wellard 2    Yes, yes… Wellard did technically die back in 2008 (no, we’re still not over it either), but Robbie’s return to Walford will also welcome the arrival of a new dog, imaginatively named Wellard 2.    Amazing.    Dean has said of the new addition to the ‘EastEnders’ cast: “Robbie and Wellard were inseparable, so it seems only right that there will be a Wellard 2. I think viewers are going to love him!”      Wellard 2    Back in June, Dean spoke of his excitement about his ‘EastEnders’ comeback, and spoke about what his character has been up to in the years since he was last on screen.    He said: “Robbie comes back from India with a son who's four-years-old.    "Robbie's grown up a bit and he's got a few more grey hairs, but in many respects he's still the same. He was always hopeless in love and hapless with cash and he returns without a girlfriend and money.”    At least he’s got himself a canine companion, though, right?    So far little is known about the circumstances surrounding Robbie’s return to Albert Square, other than that he’ll be starring in six episodes, to coincide with the departure of Carol Jackson.

Most of them come from the space and conspiracy-themed coverage we do but this has to be one of the weirdest things we've ever seen.    A photographer has captured what looks to be a weird almost organic-looking UFO in Costa Rica.        The bizarre looking object is the latest in a number of sightings that reportedly claim to break the trend of a UFO simply being a large disc that floats in the sky.    Earlier this month UFO hunters claimed to have spotted the 'Black Knight', a mythical UFO that has been talked about since the 70s when it was first spotted in orbit by astronauts aboard one of NASA Space Shuttle missions.      The mythical 'Black Knight' UFO that has been seen    Tackling the issue of UFOs has been something that governments generally steer clear of, with some leaders even passively supporting the hype.    US President Barack Obama famously avoided the question of aliens by saying he couldn't reveal anything about the infamous 'UFO Files' that apparently every president is given.    As SETI's Senior Astronomer Seth Shostak points out however, much of the evidence that we see today is actually less credible than the UFO sightings that took place back in the 60s with Roswell and Rendlesham Forest.

When they finished their meal, the couple realised their bill had a note written on it from their waitress, Daniela Bossi.    "For putting up the biggest fight, this one is on me,'' the note read.    The couple were then told that the cost of their meal had been covered by the waitress.         Rick was diagnosed with brain cancer in April. According to local news sites in New Jersey, Rick has been taking part in a rigorous clinical study of an experimental treatment by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.    He was reportedly overwhelmed with emotion at the waitress' kind gesture.

READ MORE:   First Look! 2015's 'Strictly' Stars Get Their Sequins On  Simon Fires At Strictly's Star Signing As He Ignites 'X Factor' Battle  Caroline Flack Has A Warning For One Of This Year's 'Strictly' Stars    The ‘Call The Midwife’ actress has revealed she has separated from Oliver Boot, just days before the BBC ballroom show returns to screens.       Helen George has split from Oliver Boot    The pair have been married since December 2012, after meeting on the set of BBC drama ‘Hotel Babylon’.     According to The Mirror, Helen was reportedly asked to be asked if she was single at Tuesday’s (1 September) press launch, and refused to answer.     A spokesperson later told the paper: “I can confirm that Helen separated from her husband some time ago.”    Helen is one of the 15 stars who will take to the dancefloor when the new series kicks off on Saturday.       Helen George at the 'Strictly' press launch    Married stars such as Peter Andre, ‘EastEnders’ actress Kellie Bright and broadcaster Jeremy Vine will be hoping they are not the next victims of the ‘Strictly’ curse.     Last year, it struck winner Caroline Flack, as she split with boyfriend Jack Street while on the show.     The previous series saw Susanna Reid end her 15-year relationship with Dominic Cotton, while Rachel Riley also split from her husband Jamie Gilbert, and is now dating her former dance partner Pasha Kovalev.

Bill currently fronts the show for half of the week, but announced on Wednesday that he was leaving the morning show after 15 years, to spend more time with his family (and his bees).      Bill Turnbull    Charlie Stayt, who currently presents ‘BBC Breakfast’ on Thursdays and Fridays, has been named the current favourite to take over Bill’s presenting job, with William Hill offering odds of 4/1.      Charlie Stayt    A spokesperson for William Hill explains: “Bill has a legion of fans and will be a tough act to follow but in Charlie there is obviously a ready-made replacement.    “But despite the early hours, there will be countless covetous glances being cast at the soon-to-be vacant slot on the red sofa.”      Adrian Chiles    Other early favourites for the job include Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy and former ‘Daybreak’ and ‘The One Show’ co-host, Adrian Chiles, with odds of 8/1 and 9/1 respectively.    Meanwhile, with odds of 33/1, controversial ‘Sky News’ anchor Kay Burley is among the outside favourites, as is sports presenter Mike Bushell.      Kay Burley, surprisingly, also features    Speaking about his departure from ‘BBC Breakfast’ on Wednesday, Bill said: “I agreed to come North for two years and it went so well I agreed to do another two years.    "That is coming to an end - by that time I will have been doing the show for nearly 15 years, which is more than enough for me and the audience.    "So it is a good time to call it a day and do something else. It was a long-term decision."    For the full list of William Hill's odds, click here.

Victims include a former Britain's Got Talent contestant and a wedding photographer from Dorset, The Independent reports.    Wikipedia have now banned 381 accounts for what it calls "black hat editing - the practice of accepting or charging money to promote external interests on Wikipedia without revealing their affiliation."    The series of bans follow an investigation, called Orange Moody that began in July.    In a blog, the organisation referred to the accounts as "sock puppets - a term that refers to multiple accounts used in misleading or deceptive ways."    These accounts apparently created around 210 articles that have now been deleted.    This is not the first time Wikipedia has encountered "black hat" editing.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:41:31	David Cameron Moves To Placate Eurosceptics Over EU Referendum Bill	David Cameron is set to launch a fresh move to defuse a Tory rebellion over Europe with new rules to restrict taxpayer-funded spending on an EU referendum campaign.    Government sources confirmed to The Huffington Post UK that curbs on ministerial activity during the campaign will be included in new amendments to the referendum bill to be published by the Foreign Office.    The move, part of a bid to reassure Tory backbenchers who threaten to overturn the Prime Minister's narrow Commons majority, is aimed at stressing there will be no unfair Whitehall backing for an 'In' vote.    The amendment is expected to reinstate a so-called 'purdah' period of 28 days, banning most Government activity during the final four weeks of the referendum.    However, there will be some exemptions for ministers to allow them to continue their daily duties, and Eurosceptics have warned that they want to see the final detail before backing down.    If the exemptions allow the 'machinery of government' such as special advisers and press officers and civil servants to be involved, Tory MPs could still rebel in substantial numbers, one Eurosceptic told HuffPost UK.    MPs will get a chance to vote on the bill's third reading next Monday when Parliament returns from its summer recess amid fears Labour and Tory rebels could unite to wipe out Cameron's slender 12-vote majority in a 'Maastricht-style' alliance.    Government Whips are hoping the changes will defuse the biggest headache facing the PM on the Commons' first day back.    Mr Cameron infuriated some in his party earlier this year when he unveiled moves to suspend 'purdah' that normally prevents ministers, government departments and local authorities from publishing material relating to a referendum.    Many Conservatives - and the Commons Public Administration Select Committee - worried that the 'machinery of government' would be used to promote the 'In' campaign.    Some 27 Tory MPs rebelled against the Government in June and Downing Street and the Foreign Office only avoided defeat because Labour abstained.    Crucially, however, Labour this summer tabled a new clause calling for the reinstatement of purdah rules and requiring Parliamentary approval for any exemptions for ministers.    A Labour source told HuffPost UK that with a deadline of 4.30pm today for amendments to the bill, ministers had "left it until the 11th hour and we still don't know what they're doing".    Sir Bill Cash, the veteran Tory MP and chair of the European Scrutiny Committee, welcomed the suggestion the purdah rules would be in force for the EU referendum but said he would wait to see the exact details of the amendments.    He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The real issue here is one of fairness and that's the case that we've made and also this is yes versus no. It's not a party political issue as between the political parties.    "We know there are many people in the Labour party and the SNP who very much agree with us."    Sir Bill said there were "quite a lot of people in the House of Commons" who were "absolutely clear that it is not in the national interest to use the machinery of government for the purposes of what could turn out to be support for the yes vote".    ConservativeHome's Mark Wallace was wary, however.    The essential question on purdah is what these mystery &quot;exemptions&quot; to it are going to be. Hope there's no attempt at funny business.— Mark Wallace (@wallaceme) September 2, 2015      UKIP head of policy Mark Reckless said he welcomed new 'purdah' clarity.  "We would also call for the Government to make it clear to the European Union institutions that they too should refrain from announcing new policy objectives and spending promises in the UK during the period of the campaign and also honour British purdah rules."    Mr Cameron yesterday retreated on the issue of the question to be used in the EU referendum, switching from a 'Yes/No' choice to 'Remain/Leave'.    A further climbdown on 'purdah' would be seen as a victory by Eurosceptics and proof of the PM's desire to keep his party united ahead of the referendum.    But some backbenchers want to see further changes, including a six-month gap between the end of a renegotiated position and the poll itself.     Some Tories have pointed out that while No.10 yesterday said it agreed with the Electoral Commission on the type of question for the referendum, it had failed so far to follow the independent watchdog's advice on purdah.    This summer, the Commission said it was "supportive of proposals to reinstate restrictions on the publication of promotional material by central and local government in the run up to the poll".    BBC's Newsnight reported last night that some close to Mr Cameron were eyeing a poll in the spring of 2016 rather than 2017.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:52:07	Chuka Umunna: Jeremy Corbyn's Nato and Nationalisation Views Could See Me Quit Labour's Front-Bench	Chuka Umunna today set out his red lines for serving in a Jeremy Corbyn Shadow Cabinet as he flagged up “grave concerns” over leaving Nato and renationalisation.    The Shadow Business Secretary, who withdrew from the leadership contest after less than a week, indicated he could step back from a front line role in the party as he too has “points of principle”.    Mr Umunna also warned against “flashmob democracy” after a surge of more than 350,000 people signed up to the Labour Party after the election to vote in the leadership contest.    Mr Corbyn is seen as favourite to win the Labour leadership contest, but in recent weeks has come under strong attack from his rivals over both his economic and foreign affairs policies.    Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Ummuna said: "One of the things that’s very important to me is that we maintain our pro-European stance and that we are very clear that whatever the outcome of the renegotiation and the EU referendum campaign the Labour party is clear it would stay in. It is not clear what position Jeremy would adopt in that situation.    "I have grave concerns about increasing National Insurance for middle income families by seven per cent, I’m concerned about us withdrawing from Nato and I don’t think you can go around nationalising things without compensation when, you know, we often invest in these things in our pension funds.”    When asked if he would serve in Mr Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet, Mr Umunna replied: "It would completely depend on the programme you’re being asked to sign up to. I’ve just explained to you some of the misgivings I have and some of the points of principle that I have. He has many points of principle, I have them too. It completely depends but I think ultimately we’re all keen to contribute and as I said, Shadow Cabinet is not the only way to do that.”    Labour’s membership has swelled from 187,000 before the General Election to 292,973 as of last week. In addition to full members, a further 112,799 people have signed up as ‘registered supporters’ and 148,182 are ‘affiliated supporters’.    The surge in interest has been attributed to the popularity of Mr Corbyn, who is offering an alternative economic plan based around so-called People’s Quantitative Easing – printing money to fund infrastructure developments.     There have been fears among Labour that supporters of rival parties have signed up in order to influence the election result, leading to 400 members or supporters of the Conservatives and 1,900 members or supporters of the Green Party being banned.    Mr Umunna said the increase in supporters was “a cause for celebration.”    He added: "But the real important thing now is we can’t have a kind of flashmob democracy where everyone comes in for the contest and then they flee. We want to make sure that we harness the energy that the new joiners bring both in terms of helping them get on the doorstep to sell the progressive messages we need to get across to the public but also helping them organise in their communities.     "These people have great links to local groups and organisation which will help us revive our community organising tradition."

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 08:01:08	Chrissie Hynde, It Was Not Your Fault	There have been plenty of opinions about Chrissie Hynde's recent comments about her own sexual abuse. Before we move on, let us not forget she has been a victim of rape; her comments are how she feels about what happened to her, not fact. If you are a survivor of sexual abuse the chances are you will have felt and battled with self-blame, the same as Chrissie still is now - and so did I.    This is very normal.     The most common question in sexual assault is "Was it my fault?"    There are no actions anyone can ever take that make sexual abuse permissible. The offender is always responsible for their actions.     What we should be looking at, is why "was it my fault?" is the most common question and how we change this.    We don't condemn the guy who walked down the street at night, drunk, who happens get badly beaten up. "He shouldn't have got drunk, he shouldn't have walked down the street at night. He was asking to be beaten up!" So why do we condemn the victim in crime's of sexual abuse?    To be fair in 1972, when Chrissie was raped, the majority reaction in the culture at that time would have been to blame her. Just imagine the response she would have got walking into a police station back then. Rape crisis centers didn't even exist in this country and sexual abuse most certainly wasn't on the public agenda.    I felt it was hugely important to write this, after reading some extremely disturbing comments about sexual abuse and clear a few things up which seem to reflect the out dated attitudes of 1972. Don't you think we should have moved on as culture by now?     It doesn't matter what you are wearing, whether you are drunk or not, if a perpetrator is going to rape you they will. They don't care whether you are wearing a skirt or baggy trousers or whether you are drunk or sober.     Sexual abuse is not caused by the perpetrators uncontrollable sexual urge like many people still seem to think.     Sexual abuse is an act of power and control, not sex. Most people have sexual desires, but they don't rape.     Rape myths have survived for a long time to make us feel safe so that we can say "it won't happen to me because I am not going to behave or dress like that woman, so I won't get raped."     We can second-guess our actions all we want but the bottom line is we wouldn't be sexually abused if our abuser had respected us and not committed the crime.  The fault lies there. No one has the right to rape us no matter what we are wearing or behaving like.    Whilst we put the emphasis on women to behave differently in order not to be sexually abused, we are giving an excuse to perpetrators to commit the crime of rape.     Sexual abuse happens to both men and women. It is not an issue of feminism, gender or any other label people seem to like putting on it. It is human right's issue. No one has the right to perpetrate abuse against another. No one has the right to rape you.    To say that men can't control their sexual urges if they see a woman in a skirt or drunk is deeply offensive to men and doing the majority of men out there a massive disservice.     We can continue telling women not to drink, to dress conservatively and not trust men but it won't, and hasn't, made the slightest bit of difference to the issue of rape.     Victims say no and they still get raped. So do you not think it is about time we change tactic?    A victim of sexual abuse is extremely vulnerable after the horrific violation of their body, yet we expect them to take action in a culture that still debates whether they were responsible. How messed up is that?! 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Charlie Webster	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/charlie-webster/chrissie-hynde_b_8076056.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 08:15:41	Greenbelt 2015: Corbyn's Bard, Cyborgs and the Devil	The Greenbelt festival always defies easy definition. When its line-up boasts a radical theologian talking about angels and cyborgs, music from the Polyphonic Spree and a circus dance duo performing a show inside a circular house that rolls around a field, you can see why.    The musical highlight this year was Grace Petrie and the Benefits Culture who roused a damp Monday night crowd with their politically charged folk songs.  Grace Petrie is the musical soul of Corbynmania. Heartfelt catchy tunes delivering lyrics of love and protest which sum up her generation of politically engaged youth who despise the political establishment. As she says, most of her songs are about heartbreak, either by Tories, girls or sometimes Tory girls.   The Redundancy Hymn, Farewell to Welfare and her ballad about Tony Blair, You Were Always Going To Break My Heart Honey, gives you a feel of her lyrical inspiration.     Another musical gem discovered at Greenbelt's Canopy stage were the New Portals, the brother and sister duo, formerly with The Japettos, who are now striking out with a new electronic folk pop project which looks to have huge potential.     Among the broad array of talks on offer at the festival, set in the rolling grounds of Boughton House near Kettering, Christian theologian, thinker and activist Noel Moules spoke about the concept of animism, the idea that the world is filled with persons, only some of which are human, and discussed the often overlooked common ground shared between pagans and the Bible.    Journalist Cole Moreton led a lively newspaper review session each day in which he invited both panellists and the audience to thrash out the days big issues. A poignant moment took place during  a discussion about immigration when a member of the audience spoke up, identifying herself as an economic migrant. She said she had been attracted to Britain by its values after being forced to pay a bribe in order to have her deceased father buried back home in Romania. But despite her pride when she secured residency and her British passport, she said the recent negative response from the media and sections of the public to the latest refugee crisis had made her consider giving it back.    Star Trek, Terminator, Isaac Asimov's I Robot and Channel 4's hit show Humans all featured in Marika Rose's sweeping history of cyborgs, which looked at how our understanding of machines has affected the way we think about work and the difference between robots, cyborgs (part human part machine), androids (machines that look like men) and gynoids (machines that look like women). Explaining that if you have a pacemaker, artificial hip or contraceptive implant you're a cyborg she wondered if we can now extend the definition to people who rely on the internet or their mobile phones.    One of the most popular venues was the Story Yurt run by the Christian Aid Collective. The nightly 'story slams', in front of the cosy log burning stove, proved so popular people had to be turned away.     On the stage the acrobatic circus duo Acrojou looked the part in their steam punk circular house, but for me, their best performance was the stage show Frantic examining the hectic pace of modern life and how easy it is to become swamped with busyness. Using another circular structure, weighted in such a way it seemed to disobey the laws of physics they threw it around the stage with grace and abandon. It was a joy to watch.     Closing the festival was Justin Butcher's remarkable one man play from the perspective of the Devil as he watches the events of the first Easter unfold and the crucifixion of Jesus. Butcher's explosive, swaggering and self-righteous Lucifer is a sight to behold. The physical and emotional intensity that is maintained for the full 90 minutes is impressive and the running commentary from an increasingly exasperated Devil works brilliantly.    Next year's Greenbelt festival, 'Silent Stars', takes place at Boughton House between August 26-29, 2016.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 08:22:29	Scientists Discover 'Monster-Like Sea Scorpion Predator' That Roamed The Seas 460 Million Years Ago	The fossil of an ancient giant sea scorpion, dating back 460 million years has been discovered in Iowa, US.    The four-foot long creature is related to modern-day arachnids, the same group to which spiders belong. Yes, we are also relieved we will never have to meet this eight-legged monster.        In a statement, lead author, James Lamsdell from Yale University said: "The new species is incredibly bizarre.     "The shape of the paddle - the leg which it would use to swim - is unique, as is the shape of the head. It's also big - over a meter and a half long!"    Scientists have named the new species Pentecopterus decorahensis     Studying 150 fossilised fragments, the researchers were able to suggest how the sea scorpion used its limbs.    SEE ALSO:  Student Casually Stumbles Across One Of The Oldest Jurassic Fossils Ever Discovered  Snake Fossil Discovery Shows Reptile With Four Legs  Hallucigenia Fossil Worm, Earth's Weirdest Creature Has A Face    According to a paper published in BMC Evolutionary Biology, the rear limbs acted as paddles that allowed it to swim or dig.    Describing the condition in which the fossil fragments were found Lamsdell added:     "Perhaps most surprising is the fantastic way it is preserved - the exoskeleton is compressed on the rock but can be peeled off and studied under a microscope.     "This shows an amazing amount of detail, such as the patterns of small hairs on the legs.     "At times it seems like you are studying the shed skin of a modern animal - an incredibly exciting opportunity for any paleontologist."

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 09:47:17	Wise Words: Scroobius Pip On Tackling Insomnia, Negativity And The Best Advice He's Ever Received	Spoken word artist Scroobius Pip first came to our attention thanks to his music, but in the years since he pressed 1000 copies of his debut album 'No Commercial Breaks', the Essex-born rapper has turned his hand to everything, from film and club nights to a midnight Xfm show, and most recently, his 'Distraction Pieces' podcast.     Now, he's once again preparing to host Bestival's Satin Lizard Lounge, which will play host to the UK's finest spoken word artists - so who could possibly be better equipped to take on our Wise Words questions?      Scroobius Pip    Here, he tells HuffPost UK how he copes with negativity, why Brazilian Jujitsu is on his bucket list, and the extremely practical advice he'd give his younger self...     What do you do to switch off from the world?  I struggle hugely with switching off. I recently did a sensory deprivation tank for the first time which I thought was amazing. You get in, and its water, salt and saline solution, so you float and then close it, so you're in complete darkness. It's completely soundproof and it was the most amazing reset button. I did an hour in there and it flew by.     Day-to-day, it’s tough. I suffer quite a bit from insomnia so I’m not the ideal person to ask this, but I sometimes do self-hypnosis of an evening, which is something I was taught to do when I had hypnosis to try and help with my stutter. It’s breathing techniques and specific thought routines - other that it’s just TV and music like everyone else.     How do you deal with negativity?  I’m a massive believer that we have control of our brains, which sounds really simple, but if I begin to feel down or feel negative, I’m always aware that that’s a choice. If I choose not to be, then I don’t have to be any more.     On a personal level, that’s how I deal with it, I choose not to be negative. With the public, or Twitter or social media, it’s kind of hilarious to be honest. I’m a big believer that you should take any praise you get online with a pinch of salt, the same way you would negativity. It can still be damaging to your personality, because, especially in this industry, you can become a dickhead. It’s all nice sometimes… but you should ignore a lot of it.      When and where are you happiest?  In general, in my day-to-day life of the last eight or nine years, it would be on stage. Touring is exhausting but during that 120 minutes on stage it’s a joy and the bit you’d do for free - it’s all the rest of it that’s exhausting. But I’m on a year or two off from touring now, for the first time in eight or nine years. I’d normally do 100+ shows a year. Now the place I’m at my happiest is sat in my living room with my brother, when there’s a good UFC event on. It’s quite the opposite.       Dan Le Sac Vs. Scroobius Pip performed their final gig together at 2014's Bestival     What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?  When I was 18 I tried to go and travel America on my own. I failed miserably, it was horrible but before I went - it was obviously the first time I was going out into the world on my own, as such, without any friends or contacts or anything - and everyone gave deep meaningful goodbyes, but my brother just gave a quote, from a film called ‘The Best In Show’, and he just said: “If you get hungry, eat. If you get tired, sleep.” That’s solid advice to live by really, and all you need in this world.    What has been the hardest lesson you’ve learned?  The hardest lesson implies that any of them are negative. There’s a lot of death, in my lyrics and a lot of people see that as dark or morbid, but I think everything is just part of journey as hippy as that sounds. Any hard lessons I’ve had along the way, I’m grateful for.     There’s one that I’ve maybe learnt too much, but generally being relaxed. I’m an incredibly relaxed person and as a teen I wasn’t and that made my stutter worse. And when I had the hypnosis at the time, it made me less stressed out and anxious about stuff. If anything it was too well, because it was around the time of my GCSEs, and I was too relaxed about it.     What would you tell your 13-year-old self?  I would say save up all your pocket money, and in 2005, at half-time of the Champion’s League final, Liverpool will be losing to AC Milan. Put all your money on them to win. I’d go very ‘Back To The Future’ on it, that’s the only advice I’d give.     What 3 things are at the top of your bucket list?  I would like to go to Iceland, the country not the shop, obviously.     I’d like to dedicate myself and get better at Brazilian Jujitsu. I train in it a bit, but not nearly enough.     And finally… Well, it sometimes confuses people that I do so many things. I do music, a podcast, club nights, a film night, and my on-going bucket list is just… to try and do cool shit. And I don’t mean cool as in Shoreditch, or beards or whatever, just things that are fun to do, so I’d have that as my last one - even though it’s technically neverending.     What do you think happens when we die?  Nothing. I think we just die, and I think that’s fine. In a recent episode of my Distraction Pieces podcast, it’s a sense of death special and it’s about discussing death and the ideas of death a lot more and not being scared of it. I talk to a mortician, and she explains that one of the reasons it’s so important is that she’s previously been in the funeral industry and people get ripped off. People don’t want to discuss it, so they’ll sign off on anything and on services that they don’t need, because they don’t want to talk about it, because death is scary. Life is a million times scarier than death. Death just ends, and what’s going to happen to me next week in general is far scarier to me.         When do you feel a sense that we live in the presence of something bigger than ourselves?  I definitely feel it, 100%. About three years ago, I saw Prince play, and that was evidence that we’re leaving in the presence of something bigger than ourselves. I’ve been going to gigs since I was 15 and would always spend all my pocket money on it, but Prince was the first person who walked out on stage and I was like, ‘I don’t even know what this is. This doesn’t feel just like a dude walking out’. Bruce Springsteen is famously amazing live, but he’s still just a man walking out on stage. Prince is some other worldly creature, it sounds like I’m joking, but I’m 100% serious.     What do you try to bring to your friendships and relationships?  I just try to bring what that person needs at the time. I’m always happy to talk to my friends and give them advice, but I’m also always happy to shut the fuck up, and not get involved or say, ‘here’s what you should be doing’. I try to be attentive to what they need at that point.     What keeps you grounded?  I still live in the same town I’ve lived in for 34 years, Stanford-le-Hope. I did a spoken word gig once, in front of a sold out Hammersmith Apollo, and shared the stage with Steve Coogan, with Stewart Lee, Brian Cox and so many other people that I’m so in awe of. Then I was on the last train home and some girls from Tilbury tried to steal my shoes and set fire to my beard, so that’s a wonderful of keeping grounded. Living in an area where it’s not that nice, but it’s home and it’s what I’ve known. Those girls didn’t have a clue that I’d stood on the stage and done that stuff for thousands of people - and quite rightly so.     What was the last good deed or act of kindness you received?  It’s a small one, but it’s something I always notice. Yesterday I did 10 hours of driving, and I was coming back through London and there were roadworks and traffic, and someone let me in. Everyone is always out for themselves and cutting each other up but someone held back, and let me in when they could have just kept going.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 09:53:08	David Cameron Says Taking More Refugees Is 'Not The Answer' To Crisis	The EU's current migration crisis won't be solved by the UK taking in more refugees, David Cameron has declared.    Despite a growing clamour for Britain to do more to help those fleeing war and persecution in Syria, the Prime Minister stood firm to his position that the real 'answer' lay in tackling the root causes of the problem.    But his remarks came as Germany's ambassador to the UK today added to the pressure on London, urging all EU states to do more to help and making clear that Britain should take tens of thousands more refugees to reflect its size and population.    Yesterday, Labour's Yvette Cooper became the first senior British politician to call for a specific number of Syrians to be admitted to the UK, calling for 10,000 to be settled, with just 10 in every borough.    Today, as distressing pictures emerged of the body of a young boy washed up on a beach in Turkey, Ms Cooper stepped up her demand for action.    Mr Cameron said the Government were keeping under 'review' the numbers who could be let in, yet made clear he wanted other longer-term solutions.    "We have taken a number of genuine asylum seekers from Syrian refugee camps, we keep that under review, but we think the most important thing is to try to bring peace and stability to that part of the world.    "I don’t think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees."    The Prime Minister added: "We’re taking action right across the board. We’re helping the countries from which these people are coming, stabilising and trying to make sure there are worthwhile jobs and stronger economies there.    "We’re obviously taking action at Calais in terms of the Channel, which I’ve described on previous occasions. There’s more that we need to do and we’re working together with our European partners as well. These are big challenges but we will meet them."    Ms Cooper told HuffPost UK: "When mothers are desperately trying to stop their babies from drowning when their boat has capsized, when people are being left to suffocate in the backs of lorries by evil gangs of traffickers and when children's bodies are being washed to shore, Britain needs to act.     "It is heartbreaking what is happening on our continent. We cannot keep turning our backs on this. We can - and must - do more. If every area in the UK took just ten families, we could offer sanctuary to 10,000 refugees. Let's not look back with shame at our inaction."    A source close to Ms Cooper told The HuffPost UK: "Cameron needs to get his act together and take action - of course peace and stability is needed as is helping those in peril right now"    The number of migrants entering Europe has soared this summer, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. But while Germany's refugee numbers have quadrupled, the UK has taken in just 200 Syrians.    Days after Angela Merkel made clear she was preparing to take in 800,000 refugees this year, Germany's ambassador Peter Ammon told the BBC's World at One programme that the strain was now obvious.    "Germany has taken in over the last months 43% of all asylum seekers that come to Europe," he said.    Asked if Mrs Merkel had Britain in her sights when she called for more burden-sharing, he replied: "She has everybody in her sights.     "This is a humanitarian challenge to Europe. Britain has been taking in refugees over centuries. And not to your disadvantage and I think we will expect that all partners will make the best efforts to contribute to a solution to this problem.    "Everybody knows how we feel about it, it is almost self-evident. Germany has taken in 43% of all refugees. We think that this number for Germany is too high, Germany represents around a quarter of the population, roughly a quarter of the European GDP if you take this as a yardstick. This gives you and idea how many Germany should take.  I will not tell you how many you should take."    "With the humanitarian tradition that we have and you have we should be able to find a solution. We have just seen the beginning of a humanitarian crisis, with waves of migration, which will probably shape global politics for decades to come. We have to find answers to this."    Mr Ammon agreed that longer-term diplomatic solutions in Syria and Libya and other countries were needed.    Stephan Mayer, the home affairs spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance told the Times that the UK's stance on refugees may harm Mr Cameron's ambitions to win powers back from the EU ahead of an in/out referendum.    "If the British Government is continuing to hold this position that Great Britain is out of the club in this big task in sharing the burden, certainly this could do some harm to the bilateral British-German relationship, and certainly also to David Cameron's ambitions to be successful in the renegotiation."    But Mr Ammon stressed that he would not link the UK's conduct on refugees to Mr Cameron's bid for EU renegotiation.    "I can't see that. Some people mistakenly think these negotiatons are of a bilateral nature between Germany and the UK that's not the case."    He said he was 'surprised' that the Austrian government had made a similar link between its willingness to agree British demands ahead of its referendum and EU demands that London take more refugees.    "We want to make Europe better, it's not a tug-of-war," Mr Ammon said.    Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham today accused the government of "burying its head in the sand" over the issue.    In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute Mr Burnham said: "This is a humanitarian crisis, not just a tedious inconvenience for British holidaymakers, as our government might have us believe."

And not a day goes by when we don't long for the week-long battery life it gave us.     With its monochrome screen and Snake II, it is a classic that should belong in the phone hall of fame -- if one exists.        After it was launched on September 1, 2000, the phone sold 126 million models over the next 11 years.     In addition to endless games of Snake ll it also took the pressure off sending texts by giving us a limit of 459 characters. Yes, we loved those long text messages.     Despite being a not-so-smartphone, it is one we will continue to miss.     Many took to social media to express their appreciation and nostalgia:    #IamMissingThoseDays    Nokia 3310 pe texting  — Hafsa Shykh✨ (@HafsaShykh) August 28, 2015      As of late, I'd much rather not have anyone on any social network and own a Nokia 3310 & play snake all day.— jeanie (@Lethabo_N) August 27, 2015        No lies here.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 09:58:51	Moved by Music	Some of you who read my stuff here may have noticed that I don't write very often. I need be moved, to feel genuinely passionate about something, before I put pen to paper.   And nothing, absolutely nothing, has moved me over the years quite like the music of Mikey Georgeson.   The Best of the Vessel is the new album which brings together a collection of his work that has been over 20 years in the making.   Georgeson first came to the fore back in the 90's, fronting the ridiculously wonderful but painfully ignored pop group, David Devant & His Spirit Wife.   Undeterred, Georgeson has gone on on to work under the guise of Mr Solo, Carfax (with White Town's Jyoti Mishra), and, more recently, as Mikey Georgeson & The Civilised Scene.   The Best of The Vessel is the album that brings all those elements together. And it's a blinding triumph.        Having been barred from the Brit Pop party, it seems that only now are critics reassessing the undeniable pop sensibilities of David Devant & His Spirit Wife. And hearing the songs on this album, it's an absolute wonder that it has taken so long.   'This is For Real' and 'Pimlico' are hidden classics that, back in the day, would have sat comfortably on top of the charts. With hooks that could snare a whale and lyrics packed with pathos, they'd still be perfect additions today.   I could repeat that for most of the songs here. This album is that good.   There are particular gems: 'Life on a Crescent' is a heartbreakingly delicate and perfectly formed reflection on suburban life. 'Going To London' and 'My Heroine' are quite simply two of the purest pop songs I've ever heard.   Best of all though is 'Half of It'. Again, it's a great tune, but significantly it's a new release, and a wonderful sign that even though this album is a retrospective, it shows us that perhaps only now are we really seeing the very best of Mikey Georgeson.         Over the years, Georgeson has been compared to many other performers, perhaps the most accurate being Pulp's Jarvis Cocker. They share an endearing peculiarity, an intelligent wit, an empathy and compassion that has armed them with the tools to make music that sets them apart.    But while Cocker was accepted and invited to the party - a party he wisely rejected - Georgeson has continued to work outside the mainstream. And he's all the better for it - because by ploughing a lone furrow, Georgeson has remained sensitive to both himself and his audience.  This album marks Georgeson out as an original British songwriter of lasting quality. He remains a presence somehow transcendent and other-wordly, bringing us songs that seem to have always existed, holding up the mirror to connect us to something we can truly love.   What an incredible talent.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 10:00:53	The Scotland Bill Is a Real Opportunity for Scotland - It Should Be Grasped With Both Hands	Yesterday, the SNP unveiled the Scottish Government's final Legislative Programme ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections next May. There are measures which Labour supports, but this is a programme for Government more notable for what is not in it than what is.      The Scottish Parliament has never been so powerful and that means Nicola Sturgeon is the most powerful First Minister Scotland has ever had. She has built a reputation across the UK that gives her a national platform which affords her a mandate to use those powers, which will be even greater once the Scotland Bill completes its passage through Parliament.    The Scottish Government have been quick to criticise the Scotland Bill as "limited". Fair enough: while I would disagree that the Bill is "limited" (this, after all, constitutes the biggest transfer of power to Scotland since Labour established the Scottish Parliament in 1999), I also want to see it go much further.    However, the difference between Labour's approach, and that of the SNP, is that I have identified where I believe the Bill to be deficient, and tabled amendments to improve the Bill. To date, Labour has tabled over eighty amendments, including more on social security than any other party. I see the Scotland Bill as a real opportunity for Scotland that should be grasped with both hands.    In stark contrast, the SNP Government's criticisms of the Scotland Bill essentially amount to a pick and mix selection of powers which they say they want, but not why they want them or what they would do with them if they had them.  Rather than working, as I am, to make this Bill the best it can be, they are desperate to be disappointed in order to fuel their endless narrative of grievance.    They also consistently play down the extent of the powers that are coming to Scotland. They claim that the Bill will only see the Scottish Government raise 36% of devolved expenditure, wilfully ignoring the fact that 50% of Scottish VAT receipts are also being assigned to Scotland, which means that around half of devolved expenditure will be raised by the Scottish Government.    Alarmingly, the Scottish Government continue to reiterate their demand for Full Fiscal Autonomy, despite overwhelming evidence that this would leave Scotland worse off to the tune of around £7.6 billion; evidence, incidentally, reinforced by their own Oil and Gas Analytical Bulletin and their own annual accounts..    Labour's approach to the Bill has been more sensible and more decisive. We know we want Scotland to be able to create its own social security system, so we have tried to change the Bill to make that happen, and we've extracted concessions from the Government already to ensure that UK Ministers will not be able to interfere with decisions made by Scottish Ministers on social security.    I want to ensure that the Scottish Government has the power to mitigate the worst excesses of the UK Government's punitive sanctions regime, something that the Bill as it stands explicitly restricts. So I have tabled amendments to the Bill that will allow the Scottish Government to make top-up payments to individuals who have been sanctioned. I hope and expect the SNP to support these amendments when we debate the Bill at its Report Stage.    In the final analysis, even without amendments, the Scotland Bill transfers considerable new constitutional, territorial, fiscal, legislative and welfare powers to Scotland.  But I want to ensure that the "vow" is delivered in full, in both spirit and substance. And I want it to go further by allowing the Scottish Parliament to design a new Scottish social security system.    Soon we are going to have to stop talking about the process of the Scotland Bill and get on to talking about what we would do with these new powers. Yesterday, the centrepiece of Nicola Sturgeon's Programme for Government were education measures she could have implemented at any time over the past eight years, with the powers the Parliament already has.    What is required now are the ideas, the courage, and the political will to deploy the new powers being transferred to the Scottish Parliament for positive and progressive ends. We cannot afford to prolong the artificial politics of grievance, which only undermines what should be seen as a major opportunity for the Scottish people.    This SNP Government has been in power for nearly eight years.  In a historic political context that is an incredibly long time. They have achieved little and are now promising less.  Let the new powers coming in the Scotland Bill be welcomed and utilised for the benefit of everyone. That's a prize worth grasping with both hands, and as the shadow secretary of state for Scotland I will be focussing on ensuring we get these powers and more delivered for the benefit of the Scottish people.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 10:21:35	The Air Is Toxic: Refugees and the Ghosts of European History	Before they properly industrialised their killing of Jews, Roma and thousands of other victims in large-scale gas chambers, the Nazis had experimented with gassing people in vans (Gaswagen). They would feed the exhaust fumes into the backs of the vehicles where up to 60 people were crammed into sealed wagons. Using just three of these Gaswagen in a few weeks in December 1940 and January 1941, German soldiers subjected 97,000 Jewish men, women and children to a slow, horrible death by asphyxiation.    One of Europe's darkest moments. But were these deaths any more horrible than the deaths of the 71 people in the Slovakian lorry somewhere on its fateful journey from Hungary into Austria last week? No. Of course the intentionality was very different. The Third Reich's extermination campaign was planned and ruthlessly executed on a vast scale. A loose network of modern people-smugglers certainly act ruthlessly and very often criminally, but in most cases they don't intend to kill their human cargo.    But still, a horrible death by suffocation in a pitch-black chicken meat lorry (company slogan "Honest Chicken") or in the crowded hold of a diesel fume-filled boat in the Mediterranean is still ... a horrible death. Yet what's been the political response to this horror? In many quarters it's the same "Fortress Europe" approach that's got us absolutely nowhere for years. So more fences are announced for Calais and a four-metre-high razor-wire-topped steel fence is built the entire length of Hungary's 174km border with Serbia. So while politicians like Theresa May and the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban focus on "security" - or indeed on trying to concoct a spectacularly wrong-headed system of designated "safe countries" from which asylum claimants will automatically face disqualification - the death toll mounts.    How must this look to the Syrian families who've fled their homeland (possibly escaping somewhere like bombed and besieged Eastern Ghouta)? Or to the young Eritreans escaping slavery-like military conscription in Isias Afwerki's notoriously repressive Eritrea? It looks like what it is: a drawbridge pulled up, the battlements fortified. The message is clear: Europe doesn't want you.    It's taken hundreds of drownings in the Mediterranean this year to even get European countries to talk about a humane, region-wide response to the crisis and even then a modest EU quota proposal has descended into unseemly squabbling with countries (the UK included) completely opting out. The German vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has called this attitude a "huge disgrace", and he's totally right.    Let's remember: only a tiny fraction of the world's 19.5 million refugees ever come anywhere near Europe. For example, while the 250,000 or so men, women and children who've arrived in Europe across the Mediterranean in the first half of this year is an unprecedentedly large number for Europe, it's still only around 1% of the global refugee population. Instead, vastly larger numbers are being hosted by countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Chad and Kenya. Turkey is the only European country to have accommodated significantly large numbers and Germany the only EU country. Of the four million-plus Syrians turned into refugees by conflict and persecution, many have ended up living - often quite precariously - in huge camps like Zaatari in Jordan or Ain al-Hilweh in Lebanon. Others are eking out even more precarious existences outside the camps, with some - like "the pen man of Beirut" Abdul Halim Attar - desperately trying to survive by selling small items on the street.    So while many European countries throw up the barricades and argue over a few thousand people, there are already around 1.2 million refugees in tiny Lebanon, one for every four Lebanese people. It's like the UK hosting 16 million refugees instead of the minuscule numbers that actually come here (there were 25,771 asylum applications in Britain in the year to June 2015, and on recent recognition rates only about half of these will actually be recognised as refugees).    Against this backdrop, when British politicians use dehumanising language like "swarms" of "marauding" migrants it's doubly shameful - not least because they know it will have a toxic effect, ratcheting up fear and triggering xenophobia. Meanwhile, another measure of Britain's mean-spirited response is that it's taken in - after much political reluctance and delay - only 216 Syrians under its "Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme". Instead Germany has pledged to take 35,000, Norway 9,000. (See this Sky News item on one of the rare examples of the UK actively helping a Syrian family).    Thankfully there have been more enlightened European responses. From individuals like the Calais couple Linda and Yves Aubry, to countries like Sweden and Germany, Germany in particular. There's an unmistakable historical irony to this. Germany, the origin of so much European suffering in the 1930s and '40s, is now leading the way with Europe's present-day response to the world's biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.    But political ghosts still haunt modern Germany. One of the Syrians featured in a recent Guardian account of refugees arriving in southern Germany talks hopefully of learning German and rebuilding the shattered life he's left behind in Aleppo. Jad is young and despite all he's been through mostly optimistic. Yet he's also worried about what might happen to him in Germany - he's heard about the anti-immigrant protests and violence outside asylum shelters. "I just hope I don't meet any Nazis", he says.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 10:21:36	The Samsung Gear S2 Is Samsung's Answer To The Apple Watch	This is the Samsung Gear S2. It's Samsung's answer to the Apple Watch boasting, custom-built software, a stunning circular display and a rotating controllable bezel.        Unveiled ahead of IFA 2015, Europe's largest technology conference, the Gear S2 features a stainless steel body and comes in three variants - white, silver and a more classically styled black that looks more like the watch you're probably wearing now.    So what makes this watch different from both the Apple Watch and the myriad of Android Wear smart watches that'll be announced in the next couple of weeks?    Well for starters Samsung's watch doesn't run Android Wear. Instead the company has opted for its own operating system called Tizen.    Traditionally Samsung's Tizen-based smart watches have only worked with Samsung smartphones including the Galaxy S6 Edge, a small factor that has unsurprisingly limited the company's ability to shift them off the shelves.    Regardless of its compatibility you can't argue with the S2's specs which are actually pretty impressive.    The circular 1.2-inch AMOLED screen features an impressive 302ppi so it's unlikely you'll be noticing the pixels any time soon.        At 11.4mm thick the S2 is slightly thicker than the Apple Watch but thanks to the design it hopefully won't be so garishly obvious that you'll be put off.    It'll come with 4GB of storage for offline playback of music and it charges using Samsung's own wireless charging dock, whether it'll then also work with Samsung's other wireless chargers remains to be seen.    Where the S2 remains separate from the competition is in creating smartwatches that can function without a phone.

If you're wondering why the company has moved away from Android, the simple fact is exclusivity. By using Tizen the company has complete control of the user experience from start to finish so everything will tie into Samsung's ecosystem.

Luis Torres, a student from Ithaca in Connecticut, US, set up a campaign on DoSomething.org to pressure Mirriam-Webster into action.       Torres' campaign page with the dictionary's former definition    The dictionary now defines nude as "lacking something essential especially to legal validity," "devoid of a natural or conventional covering," "featuring nudes" or "frequented by naked people".    Posting on his campaign page, the student said: "Up until August 2015, Merriam-Webster was the only dictionary that defined nude as "having the color of a white person's skin." But you all changed that! On National Nude Day, 820 of you flooded Merriam-Webster's online dictionary with comments to remove their racist definition of the word "nude" and THEY CHANGED IT.    "HUGE shoutout to everyone who participated, especially these rockstars who went above and beyond!"      The dictionary's new definition, which appears on the website    Torres' campaign received widespread support around the world, with numerous people tweeting they had no idea the dictionary's definition still existed.

"I’m very happy with the new definition. I think the new one is super inclusive with broad language. It’s a small microaggression, the word “nude” itself. It’s a manifestation of all the ideas we have as a society.    "As a white person, you might not understand why the word “nude” being defined that way is important, but you have to understand why it might be important to someone with a different perspective."

This Welsh warrior has been not just been setting the singles divisions alight but impressing in inter-gender tag matches across the country. Her recent bouts at Southside, for example, have been inspiring rave reviews and her match against Nadia Sapphire for Royal Ramblings own show proved to us that Newell has a very bright future. We were delighted to be granted a few minutes with Nixon to talk origins, observations and future plans.       How did you get into wrestling?     I used to watch it with my grandad all the time. I'd get back from school and he'd have recorded it onto the VHS. He'd say "Don't tell your mother, don't tell your nan, just watch it with me". When he died I thought "I have to get into this now". I found a training school when I was 16 and thought "this is what I want to do with my days". I haven't looked back since really.     How did the name 'Nixon Newell' come about?      Well Newell is my surname anyway. As for Nixon, I was just searching the internet for unique names. When Nixon came up, I'd never seen anyone called that, so I thought I'd take it. But it's nothing to do with Richard Nixon - we can stop that rumour now!         Who are the biggest stars you've wrestled and who would you like to face?     The biggest star I've wrestled to date is Candice LeRae. That was an experience. Our wrestling styles are so similar and we're both in inter-gender tag teams, so that was impressive but I was really nervous. I've also wrestled Leah Von Dutch and I'm going to wrestle Shanna. Ideally I'd love to work with people like Mickie James. I'm on a show with her but not wrestling her unfortunately. I'd like to go to America - to Shine and Shimmer - and wrestle some of their girls out there. I do the UK and Europe now - I recently returned from Malta. I do in Germany a lot. Hopefully I'll get to branch out a bit more and ideally I'd like to travel the world.     You have the 'Destroyer' in your arsenal [Its amazing!!]. Were you inspired by Petey Williams?     Funnily enough, no. I was doing a Pro-Wrestling Kingdom show and I used to travel around with Mark Andrews a lot (because he's Welsh). We were chatting in the car on the way and he was like "oh, you should do this move and that move" then "Oh my G-d, you should do the destroyer". I said "OK I'll give it a go and see what happens". So I turned up and Lee Hunter said he could take the move and I decided we'd do it. From there it's just erupted!    What's your view of the current British scene?     There's so many good wrestlers coming out of the woodwork. There are also so many people from America and Japan wanting to come to Britain to wrestle because the scene is so hot and that's big in of itself. There are so many great promotions too - Southside, IPW, ICW - people like that and the scene's bouncing at the moment.         Has the perception of women's wrestling changed?     Definitely - Candice LeRae has set a trend by wrestling men a lot - well, the majority of the time. So she definitely shone a light on inter-gender wrestling. It's not the reason I went into that - it was just pot luck. But obviously the singles scene is coming along, there's NXT with Sasha Banks and Charlotte and stuff like that. I've also notice a lot more females wrestling and training because of Paige and people like her. Girls thinking "I could be like that". The scene is getting a lot bigger and better for women.     There's Mark Andrews, yourself - Welsh wrestlers are excelling. Who should we look out for?      There's also Mike Hitchman (Wild Boar), Eddie Dennis, there's also a lot of upcoming wrestlers. A guy called Robbie Caine. There are a lot more in training who are non-match ready yet but are going to be incredible if they keep on going the way they are. The Welsh scene's actually starting to take off and there seems to be so many women! I'm thinking "that's kind of my gimmick, don't take it!"     As many women as there might be coming up on the Welsh scene, Nixon Newell is a unique talent. Make sure to check her out at an independent show near you. Follow her at @NixonNewell for updates and news.  	UK Sport - The Huffington Post	Danny Stone	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/danny-stone/nixon-newell_b_8022358.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport
Wed, 02 Sep 2015 10:54:00	Why I'm Crossing the Line to Stop Shell	  Emma, her daughter and the polar bear outside Shell's London offices      As London slept last night, my daughter and I helped move a gigantic polar bear through its empty streets. At times we weren't sure if we were fully awake either. There's something dreamlike about the large black eyes of this gentle giant, a mesmerising glimpse of a world beyond. I visited the Arctic last year and it has remained deep in my subconscious ever since. We are here today to stop Shell from drilling in its melting ice. We want them to snap out of this nightmare before it has a chance to take hold.      I didn't build this amazing bear and I'm not a great puppeteer, so my small contribution to today's action was a poem. You can read it here if you like. I tried to imagine what the people inside this building will say to their grandchildren about what they did.     As the world began to realise how big climate change was, and how utterly it was to transform all our lives, they took advantage of the melting ice to find more oil. In one of the world's last wild places they sunk their drills into the seabed looking for a new source of profit. We can ponder the science of climate change, or examine the risks of an oil spill in icy waters.     But at some point we must recognise that this is also a moral issue, a choice that we face as together. At some point we need to draw a line and pick which side we are on. Shell has chalked an invisible line around its building by taking out an injunction against Greenpeace. Today I decided to cross it.         Emma on her life-changing trip to the Arctic last year      I know that I'll be called naive or hypocritical, or both. The world needs oil and we all drive cars. But things are changing at impressive speed. Silicon Valley is building more electric vehicles than you can shake a stick at. Batteries are getting better all the time and soon will be in our homes and businesses.     It's not hard to imagine a future where the petrol pump is a museum exhibit that children will be boggled by. But Shell wants us to believe that this vision of the future is impossible, that renewable energy is a passing fad. In essence they are asking us to trust them to predict the future. A company that has made its billions in oil and gas wants us to believe that fossil fuels are the only thing that will ever work. So here's a tip: don't trust them. They don't have your best interests at heart.       Emma delivering her speech today    Greenpeace says it will keep Aurora here as long as Shell's rig remains in the Arctic. That could be days or weeks from now. My daughter and I will be urging them on alongside millions of people who have joined this movement. I'm proud to be here, proud of my daughter and proud of these passionate people around me.    I refuse to believe that the destruction of our world is inevitable, and that we are powerless to stop companies like Shell from trashing it. Instead I believe that we are coming a defining moment where people begin to claw back power from the corporations who have taken so much. We hear about 'tipping points' for the Arctic, but this one could actually be positive. The beautiful words of Arundhati Roy are echoing around us today: "Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day I can hear her breathing."

Intel says its latest processors, including the i3, i5 and i7 which are used in most PCs and laptops, will be two and half times faster than the current options on the market while also providing graphics that are 30 times better.        To prove their point, they used a souped-up selfie stick that had six GoPro cams showing off a 360 degree view in 4K definition.     And before you ask, no that selfie stick is not available to buy yet.    They also said the processors could be included in "notebooks and All-in-One desktop systems" that will allow us to take 3D selfies. Oh good, more tech to feed our narcissism.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 11:22:31	On China's Victory Day, Is Putin the Loser?	Russian President Vladimir Putin will be the guest of honour at China's Victory Day parade in Beijing on 3 September, just as President Xi Jinping was the guest of honour for Russia's parade in May. The two men are happy to use the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War to celebrate old triumphs and to hint (none too subtly) that they are still fighting today's fascists - whether in Ukraine or Japan. But are Russia and China really the bosom friends they like to claim? Is Russia's 'pivot to Asia' more than a piece of theatre for Western benefit?    Economically, the countries seem a good fit: China imports raw materials and exports finished goods; Russia mostly exports raw materials (especially oil and gas, which made up over 70 per cent of its exports in 2013) and imports finished goods. The Chinese economy dwarfs the Russian, however: $10.3 trillion versus $1.8 trillion in 2014.    After the West imposed sanctions on Russia last year, Russia had a stronger incentive to develop its economic ties with China quickly. A 30-year gas deal, signed when Putin and Xi met in Shanghai in May 2014, had been under negotiation for more than ten years. What changed? Russia wanted to scare Europe with the thought that its gas might be shipped east; and China saw the opportunity to bargain for much better terms.     In addition, Xi and Putin agreed a joint declaration in May 2015 on harmonising the development of the Russian-dominated Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and China's Silk Road Economic Belt, an ambitious infrastructure programme to develop a variety of transport and trade links from Western China via Russia and Central Asia to Europe.     Before the Ukraine crisis, Russia's attitude to China's plans was frosty, but now the Kremlin's priority is to keep China friendly; so the Russian side proposed linking the Silk Road Economic Belt and the EEU - a proposal which China welcomed (even if neither side can yet explain what it would mean to link two such different projects).    There are limits, however, to how far they can take their relationship.     First, their economic ties are not developing as well as Putin likes to claim. While trade between Russia and China grew rapidly in 2009-2011, it then levelled off and is now shrinking rapidly as a result of the economic slow-down in both countries and the fall in oil and gas prices. China continues to play hard ball in negotiations to increase gas supplies from Western Siberia. What is more, the EU remains a far more important trade partner for both Russia and China than they are for each other.     Second, bilateral irritants hamper mutual trust. Russia continues to sell arms to China's regional rivals, India and Vietnam. Russia's attitude to Chinese investment, especially near the border between them, is deeply ambivalent, with Russian nationalists worrying that Chinese settlers will take over Siberia. And Chinese nationalists bring up the 19th century "unequal treaty" by which China ceded more territory to the Russian Empire than to any other power.    Third, and most important, the two countries are on different development trajectories. For Russia, 'convergence' between the EEU and the Silk Road Economic Belt is a tactic born of weakness, designed to delay China's takeover of Central Asia, and to retain some Russian leverage. For China, connecting the two projects is a matter of managing Russia's fears. It allows Beijing gradually to build the infrastructure it wants in Russia's neighbourhood without provoking confrontation with Moscow.    Russia and China also differ in their approaches to international problems. Chinese officials and academics punctuate conversations on relations with the West with assurances that China seeks win-win outcomes; in private, they contrast this with Russia's zero-sum approach to its relations with the US and Europe.    Chinese experts are very clear that China does not want to get dragged into a confrontation with the West by Russia, and least of all over Ukraine (a country in which China has a significant economic stake). Despite current maritime tensions with Washington, Beijing is very conscious that a good economic relationship with the US is more important to China's development than access to Russian gas is. And China has no quarrel with the EU; in fact, it is keen to strengthen economic and political ties with Europe - the ultimate destination of the Silk Road.     In the end, Russia and China want very different things out of their relationship. Russia wants an alternative to Europe; China wants a road to Europe. Putin may pretend that he is using China as a weapon against the West; but as he watches China showing off its new military power in Tiananmen Square, he will know who the dominant power in Eurasia really is.    You can read a longer version of this piece on the website of the Centre for European Reform.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 11:24:41	Disarming DSEI: Arms Dealers And Despots Descend on London	  - Copyright, Campaign Against Arms Trade.      It's less than two week until one of the world's biggest arms fairs, Defence & Security Equipment International (DSEI), rolls into London. The biennial event (taking place 15-18 September) will bring thousands of arms companies representatives together with mercenaries, generals and military delegations from some of the worst dictatorships in the world.    The guest list hasn't been released yet, and won't be until the first day, but recent events have seen a whole range of brutal and authoritarian regimes in attendance; including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Libya. Six of the countries in attendance in 2013 were at war at the time, and nine were listed as among those with "the most serious wide-ranging human rights concerns" in the government's own Human Rights and Democracy report.    The companies they met with were every bit as bad. They included BAE Systems, which has a long history of arming dictatorships, MBDA, a missile company that armed Colonel Gaddafi, and Raytheon, whose bombs have been linked to attacks against Palestinians. Despite Israel's brutal attacks on Gaza last summer, it will host a pavilion to market its "battle-tested" weapons.    Unfortunately the organisers of this carnival of the grotesque will be supported every step of the way by the government.     Government ministers will be key to the promotion of DSEI, so will UK Trade & Investment's Defence & Security Organisation (UKTI DSO), a 130 strong government department that exists solely to promote arms exports. It is responsible for coordinating the presence of MoD officials and military personnel, as well as inviting international delegations. At DSEI 2013, civil servants from UKTI DSO held private meetings with military delegations from Oman, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Brunei, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, among others.    We are always hearing about how 'rigorous' and 'robust' the UK's arms export policy is meant to be, but nothing could be further from the truth. The UK routinely arms some of the most oppressive regimes in the world. These arms sales are not just numbers on a spreadsheet, they can have deadly results.     Last summer the then Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted it was likely UK weapons had been used in Israel's attacks on Gaza. More than 2000 people died in the bombings, and yet in the months immediately following the conflict it was business as usual and the arms sales continued unabated. Similarly, at the time of writing, UK weapons are being used in the ongoing Saudi-led bombing of Yemen, with RAF bombs being diverted to Saudi Arabia.    Over recent years UK equipment has been linked to crackdowns and human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Bahrain and Egypt. The reason these allegations have been made public hasn't been because of any sense of openness on the part of the government or the arms companies; it is because of the brave work of journalists and campaigners on the ground.     Unfortunately the UK is unlikely to act on these violations, especially not while it is lobbying the same countries for arms sales. At the end of the day, politics is about choices, you can either stand with those campaigning for human rights and democracy or with those that are oppressing them. You can either stand with those being detained and tortured or with their torturers.      At the heart of the debate on the arms trade is the much wider question about the kind of country we want to live in and the world we want to see. There is a fundamental choice to be made about the values we want to project and practice on the world stage and the kind of society we want to build at home. Do we want a government that continues arming the world, or one that focuses on promoting peace and democracy?    Events like DSEI can never be right or acceptable. Not only do they strengthen the UK's ties to dictatorships and entrench the government's role as a global arms dealer, they also provide credibility and cover for some of the most authoritarian states in the world.  Most importantly, they put weapons in the hands of despots and send out the message that the human rights and democracy are of less importance than arms company profits. The choice is simple, you can either support human rights or you can support arms sales, it is impossible to support both.     Andrew Smith is a spokesperson for Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 11:29:17	Careers Advice for Young People Needs Our Attention	Over the past few weeks we have seen a continuous stream of media coverage about the success of young people in this country - record numbers have secured places at universities and more sixteen year olds have passed their GCSEs than ever before. If education results are a barometer of the future potential of the UK's economic development then we are in a strong position. However, alongside these positive results was news from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development demonstrating that over 58% of recent graduates are in jobs deemed to be for non-graduates. For those entering university or starting their careers this summer it is an extremely nerve wracking time - academic success is no longer the guarantee it once was.     Anxiety about future career prospects is unfortunately increasingly common in young people. I was recently at a school in south London, talking to a group of 16-18 year old girls about their futures. After only a few minutes it became apparent that, although excited for the future, the fear of making wrong decisions was of huge concern.     I was also surprised by the low awareness level of the career opportunities available to them. Most were considering traditional degrees which would lead to roles directly related to the subjects they're taking at GSCE level, i.e. medicine, teaching, law, etc; and the majority had limited understanding of other routes they could explore. It struck me that a lack of knowledge about the numerous career opportunities available was, in part, contributing to their anxiety. The fear of failing was made all the greater by the fact they felt they only had a handful of career opportunities.     We cannot afford to ignore this very real gap in young people's knowledge about the wide variety of career opportunities that are available. We need them to know that a psychology degree doesn't just lead to clinical psychology, but opens doors to talent management, risk analysis, client handling, and business consultancy to name just a few. An important aspect of my role at Bank of America Merrill Lynch is exploring how we secure the best talent for the future development of our business. The world of work is constantly evolving and new technologies are changing the way we do business and the very structures of our economies. Anticipating the requirements of our future workforce is therefore incredibly important to our resilience as a business.     Looking at Financial Services in particular, challenges I'm constantly faced with when talking to young people are the stereotypes and preconceptions around careers in this sector. It is inconceivable for many that you can work for a bank without studying maths for example.  Yet the vast majority of our employees do not have a mathematical background. In fact, we proactively target people from different backgrounds - from the arts and humanities, to those who are perhaps seeking a new direction or sector such as ex-military personnel or mums returning after a career break. As such, there is a need for us to focus our recruitment and talent development strategy on informing and educating from a young age on the variety of roles companies such as ours can offer.      We recognise that if we want to keep ahead, we need to demystify the preconceptions that surround the world of work. And as responsible employees, it is our duty to help inspire and educate the next generation, so that they can make informed decisions about their futures.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 11:31:18	Has Labour Lost Its Natural Friendship With Disabled People?	On my wall I have the back of one of my business cards signed by Tony Blair (in Blue) and the late Tony Benn (in red). I got their autographs at a lobby for Roger Berry's Disability Rights Private Members Bill in 1994, which failed but it was the start of a whole raft of legislation improving the civil Rights for disabled people.    The mid-1990s were an exciting time for a young disabled person as I was, and Labour was making a lot of great promises to improve the inclusion of disabled people, which they actually delivered during their 13 years in office. Even in the 2010 General Election, it was clear to see Labour was the natural friends of disabled people, but then things started to change.    Five years on and the Labour Party is a very different beast in every respect. After failing to win the last general election with a poor facsimile of Tony Blair, like a wounded animal, it now appears to be going into a long period of rage against the general public as it turns left for inspiration, ignoring the fact we all went right. I fear whether or not Jeremy Corbyn wins the leadership race, the damage has already been done as Labour's credibility is diminished.    And what does this mean for disabled people? Well it seems Labour has abandoned most of us. It narrowly sees disability as a welfare/employment issue for those who see themselves as sick and not disabled, except when they want to be disabled to get benefits. Those of us who require support and assistance are 'helped' under the label of 'helping unpaid carers', basically leaving us at the whims of our families, who have the real choice and control. And any kind of meaningful independent living and inclusion remains only accessible to those who shout the loudest, like myself.    The party's message seems to pander to those who perceive themselves as unfit for work as a right, with negative and destructive language that should have been stamped out years ago as I am labelled as 'the most vulnerable'. And in the background, we have Labour's covert support for Assisted Dying, with both Shadow ministers dealing with disabled people showing their public support to allow us to 'choose to die'.    In recent months I have encountered the left's attitude to the meaningful inclusion of disabled people, which has to include employment in its widest meaning. I have been told that my values of inclusion are in fact neo-liberal slavery and as Kate Green MP put it bluntly 'work for disabled people is a punishment'. So what do they expect me to do with my life? The problem is they don't want me to do anything. This is the rhetoric of Corbynism and the greatest threat to many disabled people for a century.    Those on the ideologically utopia left of the party are pushing those of us looking forward towards the Tories. If we are abused as we were Tory by the left, we will end up believing them. Disabled people are only now welcome in the Labour party if they support their destructive exclusion rhetoric, where moral superiority overrides any open debate. Anyone in the Labour Party who believes everyone has a contribution to make to society without exception is now routinely burnt at the social media stake, since they will only tolerate people who pity disabled people, seeing social warehousing in the name of dignity and compassion as the only solution that can be offered.    Labour is no longer my natural friend, and it needs to work hard to deserve my friendship again. While many left wing 'disabled' activists (most of which were not active before 2010) will still argue Labour is the party for all disabled people, I believe the silent majority of disabled people will feel abandoned by them.

The aspiring singer died after suffering a collapsed lung, having been diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer, Ewing sarcoma, last year.     Speaking after her son's death, his mother, Donna recalls his "infectious smile", telling the South Wales Argus:  “He had difficulty breathing. His lung collapsed. That’s when he passed away. He died in my arms.      Ryan Howell was suffering from bone cancer    “He liked to make people laugh, that was his goal. He had an infectious smile. He would put a smile on your face.

MORE 'CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER':  10 ’CBB' Stars You've Probably Forgotten Did The Show  The 20 Best 'CBB' Moments Ever  Do You Remember These 'CBB' Winners?    Chloe was reduced to tears on Tuesday night, when Stevi showed his jealous side, accusing her of fancying their fellow housemate, James Hill.    During a private conversation in the ‘CBB’ toilet, the only room in the house that doesn’t have any cameras, Stevi was heard telling his fiancée: “I’ve seen the way you look at James. I’m just being honest.”      Chloe Jasmine hits back at Stevi    Chloe, however, seemed unimpressed with his observation, branding him "paranoid", and asking: “Are you kidding me?     “Thank you for being honest but I don’t know where that’s come from… I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong.”    While the couple later enjoyed some alone time in the garden, Stevi tried to apologise to Chloe for acting “crazy”, to which she asked him why he had been behaving strangely all day.      Awks    Over the weekend, Stevi was on the receiving end of criticism from some of the female housemates, when he enjoyed some time in the hot tub with Jenna Jameson and Farrah Abraham.    After telling Stevi what the girls had been saying about him, Chloe added: “Darling… I’m sure other girls would be a bit weird with you being in a hot tub with two retired porn actresses. I’m not that kind of girl.”    Oh dear.    ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ continues on Wednesday night, when the housemates will also be nominating for the first time.

It may seem silly, but the Border Collie is actually a lot more experienced for political leadership than some other candidates. She has even spent more time in office than GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.    The adorable dog has been the mayor of a small town in Kentucky since 2008. The 315 people who live in Rabbit Hash have had a canine mayor for seven years.    (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Posted by Mayor Lucy Lou on Wednesday, September 26, 2012  Lou won re-election in 2012    Lou's owner and chief of staff, Bobbi Kayser, told The Kentucky Enquirer she will announce her presidential run and her retirement as mayor on Saturday.    According to the Rabbit Hash Historical Society, their current mayor fought off nine other dogs, one cat, one opossum, one jackass and one human to gain the town's highest office.    It is as yet unknown which party Lucy Lou will align herself to, although she faces tough competition from local Democrat candidate Limberbutt McCubbins.    And it's not the first time an animal has run for the job. In 1968 a pig called Pigasus the Immortal tried to get into office, and a dog called Molly was beaten by Barack Obama in 2008.    It is, however, the first time a meme has run for president. We think. A candidate called 'Deez Nuts' has also thrown his hat in the ring, as well as Captain Jean Luc Picard from Star Trek and Doge.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:08:42	Mum-Xercise: A Knackered Mummy of Two's Guide... (Contains Anger, Cake, Gin, and Angry Gin-Cake)	I promised myself once I'd had baby number two, I'd finally sort it out...    Start looking after myself better; eating well, exercising regularly, drinking less wine at breakfast... and other such ridiculousness... *laughs manically whilst knocking back a shot of gin to the face*    BUT. That was before I gave birth to a child unable to sleep for longer than 43 minutes a week, who spends the majority of his waking moments firmly welded to my areola, and I remembered that when a human-being headbutts their way through your cervix over a couple of days it's a bit inconvenient and tiring and PELVIC-BONE-SHATTERINGLY-EXHAUSTING and stuff. Actually.    So in the absence of any actual time, motivation, functioning pelvic floor and sobriety... I've decided it's plan time for plan B. Which mostly involves cake (for energy), gin (for sanity), gin-cake (because I F@*KING SAID SO) and a swift reminder for me (and my botched, dangly-memento of a vagina) that owning two small people is HARD ENOUGH BASTARD WORK AS IT IS FRANKLY. And here's my guide to Mum-Xercise, the realistic way. As nature intended it (WITH WINE and stuff...)    Arm Toning - Spend at least 40 minutes a day crawling round on your hands and knees searching for the toddler's shoes. To really feel the burn, do this in shorts. This will help friction away excess elbow and knee flab.    Forearms - Allow your baby to dictate the most awkward feeding position possible in the early hours of the morning. To get a full workout, don't forget to make a bizarre claw shape with the hand of your supporting arm and lock your neck to one side whilst quietly crying inside from the agony.    Core Strength - Between the hours of 4 and 5pm, become a 'human jumperoo'... By day five, you'll barely feel it anymore... along with any actual feelings....    Legs - Bounce the baby on one leg and the toddler on the other (of course) whilst attempting to drown out the incessant drone of the YouTube 'finger' songs on the iPad... Brother finger, brother finger, where are [ALL THE KNIVES SO I CAN STABBY STAB MY EARS DRUMS UNTIL I CAN'T F@*KING HEAR] you. Also - f@*k the kinder lady.    Back Strength - Rock the baby for hours on end whilst trying to get them to sleep, and to test your back strength fully; remember to put them down just before they're ready so you have to keep picking them up again. Once they are finally down for the night, burn extra calories by training your baby to wake up every hour or so... so you can breastfeed all the cake away...    Diet - Just eat cake. But do it frickin' quickly before the toddler notices. In the utility room. Using some wind chimes to cover the munching noises. The more angrily you scoff it the less the calories count. (true).    In addition to the above, be sure to purchase plenty of exercise DVDs on Amazon just to make you 'feel thinner' and sign up for some kind of running event you have absolutely no intention of training or turning up for just so you have another thing to cry about.    Also. Gin.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:10:39	Sony's Xperia Z5 Premium Is The World's First 4K Smartphone	Sony's latest smartphone, the Xperia Z5 Premium, is the world first 4K smartphone giving users the opportunity to capture footage in "ultra-high definition" and play it back without losing any of the quality.    The Premium is the only phone in Z5 family that has a 4K display and it obviously means that you will be able to capture your favourite moments in stunning detail.        Other phones, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and Sony Xperia Z3+ only allow you to film in 4K and watch the footage by connecting it to a 4K TV screen.    In a blog, Sony accounted for the extra space 4K footage and images demand by highlighting the phone's "32GB internal memory, with the capability to take a 200GB external microSD card."    Aside from being able to take  high-def images, the move to 4K has largely been seen as a bid to revive the company's dwindling smartphone sales.    According to Engadget, Sony is losing over $1 million per day over its mobile division.    While it's too early to pass judgement on whether the 4K gamble will pay off, experts have commented on whether such "ultra-high definition" is really required on a mobile device.     SEE ALSO:  Sony Xperia Z2 Video Review: Just Another Smartphone?  Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Review: Small But Mighty  Sony Xperia Z3+ Android Smartphone Officially Unveiled In The UK     "Sony’s new Xperia Z5 Premium handset certainly packs in the pixels with its stunning 4K resolution display, but it raises the question - do we really need TV-quality screens on our phones?" Rob Kerr, from uSwitch.com told The Huffington Post.     “There isn’t really any 4K content available for mobiles yet, so this is a huge gamble for Sony, and at a time when it really needs a win following the launch of its lacklustre Z3+ handset almost a year ago."    He also added: “However, there is an argument for turning up early to the party. Sony’s already well-established in the 4K TV market, so there’s no reason why it shouldn’t attempt to set the benchmark for next-generation smartphones too."    And perhaps he is right. In April, Sharp announced plans mass produce smartphones with 4K smartphone screen in 2016.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:12:53	Pakistan's Bid to Hang a Disabled Man	For thirty-one years, I have been a witness to various governments' efforts to execute people in a variety of ways. The bizarre nature of this barbaric debate continued apace on Monday, as a judge in Pakistan faced the government's demand for a date on the gallows for Abdul Basit, a condemned man rendered paraplegic some years ago when the prison failed to provide him with treatment for tubercular meningitis.     The judge appeared sympathetic to the argument that it would be simply barbaric to hang a man in a wheelchair, but the prosecution lawyer was vehement in his desire that Abdul Basit should swing. If a man in a wheelchair killed a score of people, he demanded, would he be spared the noose? (Conveniently, he ignored the fact that Abdul Basit was put into his wheelchair by the very prison authorities who were charged with treating him humanely.)    Faced with a barrage of venom, the judge turned to the prison authorities: precisely how, he demanded, did they plan to hang Abdul Basit? The jailers muttered and stuttered, but eventually conceded that they had not yet figured this one out. The judge ordered them to return within 24 hours with a plan. None was forthcoming.    One might think that the most vengeful of governments would accept that Abdul Basit has suffered enough, whether he committed the crime or not. While he has been on death row for a decade (itself a dreadful punishment), he has come within hours of execution twice already this summer (which verges on torture), and his volunteer lawyers have had no time to investigate any claims of innocence, given the arguments over how the noose should be applied.     In the meantime he has been paralysed from the waist down, with creeping loss of his upper body movement. He has lost all sphincter control. He cannot walk even a brief distance. He cannot climb the steps to the gallows. He cannot stand on the trapdoor, with the noose around his neck, to await his death.    Back in the day - when Britain killed people who we thought had killed people to show that killing people was wrong - the notorious hangman Albert Pierrepoint would come in to measure the condemned man's neck, and weigh him, to calculate the distance of a final drop that would break his neck without wrenching the head from the torso. It was a strange and sickening science that ultimately led Pierrepoint to declare his opposition to capital punishment.     It is rather chilling to imagine what will be taking place in the coming days, as Pierrepoint's Pakistani descendants ponder how best to kill this man. They will presumably be pulling out their paraplegia charts, factoring in the weight of his wheelchair, and wondering how best to roll Abdul Basit into place, all in the name of justice. Let us hope that sanity prevails.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:14:38	Silence Is Golden?	For the end of my book Mindfulness for the Frazzled I wanted to be my own guinea pig so had a brain scan done before and after a silent six day retreat practicing mindfulness eight hours a day. It's a mental boot camp called Tigonos Retreat Centre somewhere in the back hills of  Wales, it's August and it's winter.  As soon as I get there I realize I'm sick to my stomach and have to lie down. This could be because I find out about the daily schedule.     DAY 1    I get up to my phone alarm at 6:57am for 7am mediation (I like to cut it close for adrenaline rush reasons, even in a retreat), so I scramble into the large meditation room where people are already sitting; some wrapped in shawls in Buddha positions, some on cushions and some on the latest in meditation accoutrements for your bum; a zafu (google it); it's a cushion. I took to a chair, just to rebel.      I'm not having the greatest time. When you sit for more than three hours, your internal voice is screaming for it to end and begging for  the 'ting ting' that signifies the sitting is over.     After sitting, walking, sitting, finally there's a' ting' to have lunch. Everyone waits in the queue, no one pushes, everyone's considerate; opening doors for you, handing you cups.  I like all these people mostly because I don't have to talk to any of them.  Your eyes never meet because as you don't have anything to say, there's no reason to look at each other.  You save so much energy when you don't have to say, "Thank you" or "Sorry" all the time;  it's such a relief.  So now all I have to do is focus in on what I'm eating.     Today I fall in love with a digestive biscuit. I've had them before... but not like this. I have one bite and I almost tip off my chair with the burst of salt and sugar and crunchiness; it is perfect.  I never want it to end.  You start to slow down your chewing and stop thinking about taking another bite before you've even swallowed what's in your mouth. (My mode of eating). You savour the moment because the experience is so poignant; letting the taste,  better than anything a five star restaurant could offer, become your only focus of attention; all thoughts are gone.  I end up wrapping the other half of the biscuit in a napkin, saving it in my shoe for a special occasion. And then the 'ting' happens to indicate lunch is over and like in a zombie film, we all  go  back into the room to our special zafu, or chair in my case.     I start nodding off while I'm sitting on my chair, thinking that time is going so slowly but even here it still moves on. (I think I am being very  profound). To cut a long long story short I lived to tell the tale. For what happened next read my book...      My new book will be published in January 2016 - be the first to find out more here. Until then, I'll be back on the road with Sane New World. There are still some tickets available.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:16:54	'Everest'	Rating: ****    After Gravity in 2013 and Birdman last year, both Oscared, comes Everest as the Venice Festival's opening film. Will the Working Title produced epic, about a real mountain rescue back in 1996, continue that success? If it does, the 72nd Festival can still hold its head up high against the huge and ever more important Toronto film jamboree that immediately follows it. It is on such matters of prestige that film events are judged, whether it is fair or not.     My guess is that Alberto Barbera, the popular Venice chief, has probably done it again. Everest is not a masterpiece. But as a well-acted and directed, and a not absurdly dressed up and fictionalised account of an ascent of Everest that suddenly, and almost fatally, went wrong, the film stands up well. It is at the very least a 3D spectacular that never forgets it is about people as well as the most famous mountain in the world.     These people, the group doctor explains at the start, are going to "die a little" on the way to the top because of cold, danger and particularly lack of oxygen. It frightens some, particularly the women relatives left behind. But it has to be said. Climbing mountains just because they are there is always a risky business and always will be.     The climber we watch most carefully is Jake Gyllenhaal, who has a pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) back home and who is one of those left alone when the storm breaks. He looks certain to die before helicopter rescuers can get to him. He doesn't. But he loses both hands and his natural nose to frostbite before gaining a daughter by way of compensation. Gyllenhaal is good at showing us toughness and suffering, and here he does it well again.      It must have been a tough shoot for everybody, including Icelandic director Baltazar Kormakur, who orchestrates the whole thing with a sure touch, and as importantly achieves the 3D camera work without the usual sense of straining for effect. Everest is one of those cinematic spectacles that doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience and tries to tell the truth about an extraordinary adventure as solidly and dramatically as it can.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:19:02	Russell Group Universities, You're a Disgrace	Russell Group universities, you're a disgrace. Your silence on maintenance grants shows your contempt for widening access for the poorest students, and your total lack of commitment to playing a role in reducing educational inequality.     While a lot of the debate around maintenance grants has focussed on the overall impact that their loss will have, I'm here to talk about the complicit role that Russell Group institutions play in perpetuating an elitist education system in our country.     Said institutions are culpable for sustaining an education system riddled with inequality, where predominantly white and middle to upper class students dominate Oxbridge, Durham, LSE, UCL, among others. And yet, when cuts to maintenance grants threaten to either maintain the status quo in terms of the Russell Group's appalling lack of diversity, or make it worse, we hear nothing.     Of course, the Russell Group blames students for not getting the right grades. It would be disingenuous to ignore the fact that schooling plays a fundamental part in a young person's progression to university. However, on the lack of diversity within the Group, blame falls squarely on the elitist shoulders of these institutions. The levels of inequity in the system cannot be blamed on students, when the disparity between opportunities for poor and rich students has remained consistently marked for the past twenty years.     Earlier this year, the Department for Education released statistics demonstrating that pupils from independent schools are more than twice as likely to go to a Russell Group university.     Worse, you are five times more likely to attend Oxford or Cambridge. Or, should you even contemplate studying in London, the cost of living is becoming so extortionately high that studying at a London institution is no longer a viable prospect - unless you have parents who are able to bankroll you the money required to rent and live in the most expensive city in the country, or get into serious debt (overdrafts are a thing too, Osborne).     Yet when we talk about university access, we are peddled the same story time and time again, of tuition fees having actually expanded access to university, with more applications from the poorest students than ever before. Jo Johnson himself wrote last week in the Evening Standard, boasting of the access that universities have given to poorer students, and claiming that an expansion of student numbers will facilitate further social mobility.     On the raw figures, yes, expansion of the HE sector has resulted in more disadvantaged students going to university. Yet there is a very different story that is being glossed over by the Westminster elite, that of the fact that the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering the most selective universities has not changed for the past twenty years. The elite are still elite, and they are getting away with it.    Russell Group universities should not be allowed to expand while their record on diversity is so poor, and while their nonchalant approach stifles social mobility for young people. If they are not prepared to speak out about cuts to maintenance grants, which tangibly places more debt on poorer students than the rich, then there cannot be a genuine claim to committing to 'widening participation'.     Interesting arguments get trotted out as to why changes to grants and fees are not of relevance. On the face of it, students will be able to access more money through a maintenance loan than they do through the current grant system. It is not paid up front, as we are aware, and so some might argue that this is more a cosmetic change than anything else, with a psychological impact on the minds of young people rather than an economic one.     Psychology matters though. In a study conducted by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON) earlier this year, they found that students from lower socio economic backgrounds were twenty percentage points more likely to go to university where they live because of costs.     When we consider that universities like Oxford, Cambridge, LSE and UCL come with hefty living costs and rents, you would expect these institutions to be speaking up about the risk that maintenance grants poses to the recruitment of these students.     It also shows that Jo Johnson's sweeping statements about student numbers show a lack of any basic comprehension of young people and how choices are made about our futures. Money matters, and so does location. Russell Group universities are poor at recruiting students from the North, and cuts to support will only maintain that.     The reality is that Russell Group institutions stand to gain the most from these reforms. If the Treasury is able to reduce the so-called financial burden of supporting students from poorer backgrounds going to university, expansion of the higher education sector becomes more viable as universities are able to self finance through charging fees. While this is not exclusive to Russell Group universities, they are desperate for expansion in order to fund their research activities and compete on an international level with universities that have endowments they could only dream of.     Aspirations around expansion means that diversity is treated as an afterthought, an irritant that universities have to deal with once it becomes time to submit their reports to the Office for Fair Access. There are clear choices that elite universities could be taking about where to put their money; instead of funding glorious new buildings, they could be investing in intensive outreach programmes, or in making accommodation affordable at university for students, or in providing better and more targeted scholarships. But, all these things would require a commitment to values related to diversity, which is essentially non existent.    It is time to get real about educational inequality. Elitism in higher education in the UK is rife and it is time for both the government, and university leaders to spend a few minutes to give a bit of thought to what it really means to have education as a vehicle for social mobility.     The first step is by speaking out against the disgraceful cuts to student support and maintenance grants, and protecting funding that really makes a difference of students. So, Russell Group, step up. 	UK Universities 	Nona Buckley-Irvine	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/nona-buckleyirvine/maintenance-grant-loan_b_8065290.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-universities-education

The thought of it being England is too painful to think about right now, by hook or by crook England must muscle past Ireland on home soil.     Last night I sat down with a cup of tea and re-watched England's performance at the Stade de France and after twenty minutes I was wishing that my tea had a spot of gin in it such was the frustration of seeing the side give away penalty after penalty. After the full eighty minutes I came to the conclusion that it was the worst England performances that we have seen in months.     This weekend England must deliver from the word go, they cannot feel their way into the game, they must fire out of the blocks, take hold of the game and never give Ireland a chance. Stuart Lancaster has tweaked selection in order to deliver a marked improvement at the set piece and to maximise the number of 'leaders' on the field. Geoff Parling, as first choice lineout caller, enters the row alongside Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood will wear the six jersey as he also offers another jumping option and Ben Morgan is handed the eight shirt for his ability to deliver 'game changing moments'.     History tells us that matches between Ireland and England are fractious and intense at the best of times let alone with the added pressure that the timing of this fixture brings. Ireland name their side on Thursday and we all, including Stuart Lancaster, expect it to be a full strength one and England will have to content with everything that they bring - aerial bombardment and a tremendous physical intensity.     As has been the case for much of the summer they'll be a great deal of focus on the centre partnership as Brad Barritt and Jonathan Joseph will start their first Test together. One game out from a World Cup the timing isn't ideal however Stuart Lancaster believes that we should still expect plenty from the duo;    "We should expect a strong performance from both. They are both high-quality players. If Brad had been fit for the Six Nations he would have started alongside JJ on the back of what he'd done in the autumn straight up but he wasn't so Luther got his chance. That combination of Ford, Barritt and Joseph have trained together consistently against Farrell, Burrell and Slade for two weeks now. It's not as if we have suddenly put them together on Saturday. There has been a lot of work done together on the training field. Obviously that has to translate into a game. When you have two quality players with the work we have done you should be confident they will be cohesive."    Cohesion across the park is king, we cannot see another performance that is 'blowing the cobwebs away', there simply isn't time for it. A familiar and focused England side must step out onto the pitch at Twickenham Stadium, the England side that we know and love. England must make life immensely difficult for Ireland, they must have a solid and destructive set piece and in attack run lines and moves that make Twickenham explode with noise. England's discipline must be on point, we all know that Nigel Owens is the best in the business and as a collective Chris Robshaw and his side must quickly understand Owens' perspective and adapt to it.     It is fair to say that the pressure on their shoulders of this England XV and bench has escalated to a scale that none will have experienced whilst wearing the red rose of England. The white hot pressure of the Rugby World Cup has arrived, two weeks early, and in the words of Stuart Lancaster 'we will learn a lot about these England players on Saturday afternoon'.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 12:23:18	Gears Of War Ultimate Edition Review: Best Friends Forever	Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is in no way a new proposition, despite the fact it has just been launched for Microsoft's newest console, the Xbox One.    Yet as we look at the charts for the week we see that it has beaten all the new titles to the top spot.     Is it because of a longstanding dedication to the series? Is it because it was a superb game and people are hoping to re-play it at in full-HD? Or is it simply because Gears of War was the game that you and a friend grew up playing together?    All three are relevant, but in my case it was the third.      The ultimate buddy movie is actually a video game.    Launched in 2006 to major acclaim, Epic Games' new title was a visually-stunning demonstration of just what the Xbox 360 could really do.    While Halo might have brought people over from the original Xbox, Gears of War became the 360's equivalent of The Order: 1886, minus almost all of 1886's negatives.    Gears was technically and visually superb, right down to the game's innovative reload mechanic that would have you screaming in frustration as you hit the bumper button at just the wrong time.      This guy looked terrifying in 720p, turns out he's a lot scarier in Full-HD.    Everything about it just worked, and worked so smoothly that you could focus on just playing through the plot that quite literally steamrolled you from the start to the end.    Set on a planet called Sera, Gears of War placed you into a brutal, broken world of ruins. After a devastating attack from an alien race called the Locust, the humans decided the only way to stop them was to demolish their own cities using weapons of mass destruction. As a result there are no civilians in Gears of War, just the remains of civilisation.    Dumped rather unceremoniously into this polygonal hell hole are you and a friend.      BFF'S    That's because Gears of War is best played with friends. The AI is good, but when you can split-screen it with a friend over the course of an hour it quickly reminds you that this was one of the best games of the previous generation.    Thanks to Epic's superb cover system which lets you hug almost any surface the game strikes the perfect balance between asking you to surge forward and hang back. It's the ultimate see saw for a fledging player and allows you to enter any situation having just picked it up and not totally fail.      You won't want to take on this chap alone, he looks pretty unhappy.    As you progress through the fight Gears throws more at you, stopping just short of being overwhelming but still tempting you to jump out from behind cover and go on some mad suicidal run.    It's an addictive tide of gameplay that, combined with the fact you have to time every reload with a button press perfectly, makes for truly addictive play.    All of this combined results in an enormous quantity of evenings being spent with your friend Liam, either shouting at each other for foolishly rushing into certain death or shouting at the screen when some grave injustice takes place regarding a certain reload mechanic.    Because this is a predominantly visual overhaul the AI is still going to frustrate you in places, and having spent nearly 10 years playing video games since, there are mechanics which simply just feel dated.    It's no different from a vinyl though, you still listen to it despite its imperfections.      We're pretty sure he doesn't want a hug.    Would I say it's better than our other nostalgic classic remake, Halo? Certainly in terms of content Gears wins hands-down because you'll get every Gears previous in the form of Xbox's backwards compatibility program.    That means that if you buy Ultimate Edition between now and the 31 December you'll be able to then download Gears 2, 3 and Judgement Day for free.    Thanks to the Xbox One overhaul it looks stunning. It's sometimes hard to work out how badly a game has aged and while it won't be as bad as Halo was, the differences are immediately noticeable.    There's more content (thanks to the addition of PC levels which never made it onto the console) and it even acknowledges that much like the consoles, friends also have to move on.

Xbox Live is on hand though to make sure that when I do still want to have a catchup with him, I can just put on a headset and forgo the fact I'll look like a bit of an idiot in the name of catching up with a mate.    Some friends we meet for coffee, others we FaceTime, but for us, it's a couple of hours of Gears of War.    I would recommend it for the nostalgia alone but thankfully I don't need to, because the rest is just as good.

Channel 4’s Political Correspondent Michael Crick this afternoon tweeted that a pro-Corbyn organiser for Unite – Britain’s biggest trade union – wanted to cull “careerist” MPs.    Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt was one of those identified, as well as three MPs based in Lewisham, South East London: Vicky Foxcroft, Jim Dowd and Heidi Alexander.    Mr Danczuk was also cited as facing deselection as a Labour MP, with the unidentified organiser telling Mr Crick the Rochdale MP has "made such vicious anti-Corbynite statements that he's somebody in our cross-hairs"    Speaking to The Huffington Post UK this afternoon, Mr Danczuk did not seem worried by the threat.    He said: “I am disappointed that comrades should talk in such a vicious way.     “After the leadership election – whoever wins – we will all have to come together to take the fight to the Tories.”    Pro-Corbyn Unite organiser on plans to cull &quot;careerist&quot; MPs.

He even suggested the veteran MP could face a coup on “day one” of becoming Labour leader.    The comments will risk further stoking up tension between Corbyn supporters and those within Labour who do not share his views.    Some Labour MPs who are against Mr Corbyn becoming leader have been branded ‘Red Tories’ on social media sites by some of the leadership candidate’s more tribal backers.    Lewisham Deptford MP Vicky Foxcroft was only elected to Parliament in May, having previously worked for Unite. She is backing Yvette Cooper for the leadership.    Jim Dowd has been MP for Lewisham West and Penge since 1992 and served as a Government whip under Tony Blair from 1997 to 2001. He nominated Liz Kendall for party leader.    Heidi Alexander was elected Lewisham West MP in 2010 and is backing Andy Burnham’s leadership campaign.    A spokesperson for Unite said: "A Unite member in London, not a supporter of Labour, has been speculating about the deselection of local Labour MPs. This is not Unite policy at all, either in relation to the MPs named or in general, and his remarks have no authority from the union. They are designed to help Labour's opponents and should be entirely disregarded."

Now while it looks just like any normal stylish jacket it actually offers something a little different.    That's because you can pay for things with it. The company has partnered up with bPay by Barclaycard to create the first jacket that'll let you pay for anything up to £30.        Taking on the likes of Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, bPay is an all-inclusive contactless wallet that lets you transform items into payment cards without having to worry about the security implications that come with just using your normal card.    Appearing in the form of a wristband, keyring fob and sticker, the chips are all capable of registering to one account so all you have to do is top it up when you need to and you're good to go.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 16:15:29	'Great British Bake Off' Episode 4 Review: Nadiya Star Baker, Ugne Goes Home, And Paul Brings Us 'Gusset-Gate'	This week's 'Great British Bake Off' surpassed itself - tears of pride, a taste of humble pie, and the delightful sound of irrepressible giggles over what we can only call 'Gusset-Gate'.     The fifth round's challenges recognised some of the dietary restrictions faced by a fair share of the 10 million viewers tuning in - hence the bakers had to create sugar-free cake, gluten-free pitta and finally dairy-free ice-cream.     And it was the final task that was the undoing of Baker Paul, as he toiled gamely to dress with icing a sunbathing lady on top of his desert island theme.       Surely she gets points for the sunglasses    Both Sue and Mel got involved, helplessly offering advice to avoid the lady in question be arrested, and all three were left sprawled across the counter in giggles. Utterly wonderful telly.     Meanwhile, we could have set our watch by the latest disaster, and this time it was poor Ugne, whose cake looked like it had collapsed. She had an equally bad time with her showstopper, and it was soon early tent-flaps for the adventurous baker, leaving behind an emotional Nadiya to claim this week's star gong, and an off-form Ian to wipe his brow and acknowledge he'd dodged a bullet in what would have been a shock twist after three wins on the trot.       Poor Ugne's fate was sealed pretty early on in this week's health-conscious challenge    What else did we like?     Ian coming undone in the signature dish. Ok, so he came good with his show stopper, but he definitely tasted some… humble pie.     Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry doing their best to make out that the pocket capacity of a gluten-free pitta is as engrossing as any big, creamy black forest gateau (apart from Doret's, naturally).     Nadiya coming good. Star Baker, proud of herself for the first time ever, apparently, and not a dry eye in the house.     Who do YOU think is destined to be this year's Great British Baker?

MORE 'CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER':  10 ’CBB' Stars You've Probably Forgotten Did The Show  The 20 Best 'CBB' Moments Ever  Do You Remember These 'CBB' Winners?    Farrah Abraham received the most nominations of all the housemates, mostly due to the large number of arguments she’s been involved in since entering the house just under a week ago.    James Hill, who nominated Farrah, said: “She’s been rude to me, she comes out with silly things that she can’t explain. I don’t know if she fancies me... but I’m getting f***ing sick of her.”      Farrah Abraham    She’ll be joined up for eviction by Janice Dickinson and Daniel Baldwin, who each received four nominations from the rest of the housemates.    Speaking about Janice, Austin Armacost admitted: "Everybody’s tiptoeing around her, everybody’s extremely uncomfortable."      Janice Dickinson    While Janice’s nominations were largely due to her fiery nature and reluctance to do… well… anything around the house, Daniel was put up for the axe because of his loud voice and dominating way of talking to the housemates.    Chris Ellison told Big Brother: “He’s never really interested in what anyone else has got to say. It’s just what Daniel has got to say, and it’s usually said very loudly.”      Chris Ellison    Meanwhile, Chris received two nominations, while Stevi Ritchie and Chloe Jasmine - as one joint housemate - received three, as did Jenna Jameson.    Austin Armacost, Bobby Davro, Fatman Scoop, Gail Porter and Natasha Hamilton all received no nominations from the rest of the group.    The public will choose their first ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ evictee of the series later this week.

HuffPost UK were among reporters given a sneak peek at the dramatic showdown at a London press event, and let’s just say the duo don’t exactly get off to a good start.       Finally!    Despite Phil’s best efforts, Sharon makes her way to the Arches, and once she’s over the shock of seeing someone return from the dead (again), she wastes no time in revealing exactly what she thinks of Gillian Taylforth’s character.     In short, they end up having a mahusive fight, and Gillian loved filming every minute of it.     Speaking at the event, she explained: “I’ve always wanted to do something like that. It was lovely to, at last, after all the things Sharon had been saying, go ‘You know what? Shut up!’     “Kathy’s been so downtrodden for the last few episodes. Gavin’s been telling her what to do all the time, and Phil’s been pushing her into the back of the car, then Sharon has, it’s lovely to at last go ‘I'm going to tell someone what I think!’”      Kathy's reappearance echoes Dirty Den's return from beyond the grave     The soap’s executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins also shared his thoughts on the dramatic showdown, which will be screened on Monday 14 September, explaining: “In that episode you’ve got Letitia Dean and Gillian Taylforth, two great actresses who were in the first ever episode of ‘EastEnders’, going for it and showing how amazing they are.     “[Bringing Kathy back] was about going back to our history, and bringing back a Beale matriarch that we all want to see.”      There's certainly a lot for the two women to talk about    It’s been months since Kathy’s return first broke Twitter during the show’s live week, and in the coming months, viewers will see her attempt to reconnect with her family, while fleeing from her husband Gavin.     It’s likely we’ll see plenty more confrontations too, as the character’s relationship with Jane Beale isn’t going to be much better than the one she has with Sharon. Oh Kathy, it’s good to have you back.

In the coming months, ‘EastEnders’ fans will see Kathy Beale’s presence revealed to the residents of Walford, but it’s not just those who knew her that will be unimpressed.    READ MORE:  'EastEnders' Actress Discusses Emotional Stillbirth Storyline  Look Who's Making A Surprise Return...  'EastEnders' Spoiler! Has Sharon's Dad Been Revealed?     The soap’s boss Dominic Treadwell-Collins has revealed that while Ian Beale and Ben Mitchell will obviously struggle to comprehend that their mum is actually alive, Jane Beale’s reaction is also one to watch out for.       Kathy and Jane Beale    Speaking at a press event, he explained: “The reactions we’re holding off are from Ian and Ben.     “They’re going to be the most exciting people and it’s big, heavy heavy stuff - but then we’re throwing Jane into the mix too.”    Dominic went on to tease how Jane - who quite frankly, has a lot going on at the moment - will react to Kathy’s reappearance.     “We’ve always said ‘Ian’s married a woman like his mum’, and ‘how would Jane and Kathy get on’, and they don’t get on…” he teased. “It’s all quite sparky, and then of course you have the Bobby business going on through that.    “It [Kathy’s arrival] adds a whole new dimension to what’s going on in the Square.”      Before facing Jane, Kathy has to deal with Sharon     Kathy’s arrival couldn’t come at a more testing time for the Beale family, as Max Branning’s murder trial is currently looming in the distance, and they’ve been struggling to cope with the pressure of watching an innocent man go to prison.     Before Kathy faces Jane, there’s the small matter of Sharon, and the two women will finally come face-to-face in the near future.     Kathy won’t arrive alone either, and when her husband Gavin catches up with her, he could bring some shock news for Sharon Mitchell.

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 19:10:18	‘EastEnders' Spoiler: Paul Nicholas's Character, Gavin, Named Soap's 'Most Dangerous Villain Ever'	‘EastEnders’ boss Dominic Treadwell-Collins has teased details of Paul Nicholas’s character, Gavin, ahead of his arrival in Albert Square.     READ MORE:  'EastEnders' Actress Discusses Emotional Stillbirth Storyline  Look Who's Making A Surprise Return...  'EastEnders' Spoiler! Has Sharon's Dad Been Revealed?    Fans already know that Kathy Beale is fleeing her husband Gavin, and the soap’s executive producer has now revealed that she has a very good reason to be on the run.       Paul may be all smiles on set, but his character's not exactly a bundle of laughs     Speaking at a press event, Dominic revealed that Gavin isn’t someone to mess with, and even went as far as suggesting he could be the soap’s most ferocious baddie.     “Paul Nicholas created, I think, the most manipulative and dangerous ‘EastEnders’ villain we’ve ever had,” he said. “He makes Archie Mitchell look like a Care Bear.”    Yes, that’s right. He makes the murderous, abusive, rapist Archie look  like a child’s cuddly toy. We’re genuinely terrified.     Actress Gillian Taylforth, who plays the returning Kathy, revealed the impact Gavin has been having on her character, stating: “There are reasons why this manipulating person [Gavin] controls everything she does.     “Kathy can’t function without this person, and hopefully she will get her boys [Ian and Ben] back, but she has to explain so much to them.     “When they find out why she’s become the person has, they start understanding that their mum has been brainwashed. I’m hoping they’ll forgive her.”      Eeeeeek...    While bosses are keeping details of Gavin’s hold over Kathy under wraps, it has been revealed that he’ll come face-to-face with everyone’s favourite hardman, Phil Mitchell.     The Mitchell-Beale family trees are tangled enough as it is, but earlier this month, eagle-eyed fans noticed that things could step up a notch, as Gavin may well be Sharon’s real dad.     Given that Sharon and Kathy aren't exactly set to see eye-to-eye, we're excited to see how that all plays out…         LIKE US ON FACEBOOK | FOLLOW US ON  TWITTER 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Rachel McGrath	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/02/eastenders-paul-nicholas-gavin-kathy-beale_n_8077666.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

Wed, 02 Sep 2015 23:14:07	David Miliband Lauds Germany's Response To Syrian Refugee Crisis, UN Official Says Britain 'Can Do More'	NEW YORK -- Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband lauded the leadership show by Germany in the Syrian refugee crisis on Wednesday, contrasting Munich's promise to take in 800,000 refugees with the responses of Britain and the US.     Speaking on MSNBC in New York, the President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee commented on the contrasting reactions of Europe's two economic titans -- Germany and Britain.    Unlike the German government, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Wednesday that allowing more refugees into Britain was not the answer to the crisis.      “The conscience of Germany has been pricked in a very fundamental way,” said Miliband, noting that both sides of the coalition government in Munich are “committed,” aided by “leadership from the top.”       Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband praised Germany's 'leadership' in the Syrian refugee crisis on MSNBC on Wednesday    “For historical reasons Germany has a special thought about its role in humanitarian crises,” he added. “Germany is also now the largest country and the largest economy in Europe and this question of what German leadership and German responsibility means in a modern world is a very big question in Germany.”     “After all the drama of the European [financial] crisis, in which Germany was accused of dithering and being slow, here’s a chance for Germany to show real humanitarian political leadership that not just Britain but the US simply can’t keep up with,” he added.     Miliband said the “main source of refugee numbers” is the five-year Syrian war, noting that 60 percent of the refugees met by International Rescue Committee staff on the Greek Islands were from the war-torn country.     The former foreign secretary noted the dangerous trope in Britain of confusing the term “refugee” with “migrant.”     “The status of someone with a well-founded fear of persecution, which is the definition of a refugee in international law, that’s being muddied, diluted and undermined by talk of migrants who choose to come from economic reasons.” he said.     “It’s really important to say to people this isn’t about being politically correct; it’s about being correct. A refugee is fleeing persecution; an economic migrant or immigrant is seeking a better life. It’s not that one is good and one is bad. They’re different.”     “A refugee has rights in international law, rights to protection and responsibilities from governments that need to be upheld and one of the challenges now is to ensure the very notion of a refugee is not lost in the headlines about a migrant crisis.”     Powerful UK newspaper front pages  #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/HzeXkhSYi1— Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) September 2, 2015      On the US, Miliband said the country’s record in taking refugees from Syria “does not amount to leadership.”     He said: “The United States since the Syria conflict began has taken 1234 Syrian refugees. The State Department announced last week a target of 5,000-8,000 in 2016, but that is way below the kind of leadership needed for America to play its historic role, never mind to compare to this German reaction of 800,000 refugees.”     Earlier on Wednesday, a senior United Nations official said Britain "can do more" to ease Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Appearing on Wednesday’s “Newsnight,” Peter Sutherland called on the UK to take more refugees fleeing Syria after pictures emerged of a drowned toddler washed up on the coast of Turkey.     The little boy, named as Aylan Kurdi, was one of 12 who drowned after their boat capsized off travelling to the Greek island of Kos from the Turkish town of Bodrum. His family reportedly fled Kobane last year to escape the Islamic State group. Twenty-three people were on the flimsy vessel. Nine are believed to have survived, including Aylan’s father. His mother and brother, however, perished.     The sickening images, widely published by the British press, have ratcheted up pressure on David Cameron and the UK government to act.     Sutherland, the UN’s special representative on international migration, said Germany, Sweden, France and Italy are "massively bearing the burden," however Britain was among a raft of European states that could do more.     Earlier on Wednesday, a government spokesman reacted to the “shocking” pictures by suggesting the UK was one of the country’s doing most to ease the crisis.     “We continue to be at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria -- including as the second biggest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid, having already pledged £900 million," the spokesman said.       A Turkish gendarmerie soldier moves the body of the Syrian boy who was one of 11 people to die after a boat sunk while trying to reach Greece     However, some two of the Labour leadership contenders rounded on the prime minister, demanding greater effort from the government. Andy Burnham called for Parliament to debate allowing a greater influx of refugees while claiming David Cameron’s reaction has “veered from the inadequate to the misjudged.”    On Tuesday, Burnham’s rival Yvette Cooper called for Britain to take 10,000 Syrian refugees, saying: “We cannot keep turning our backs on this.”     Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the government was “morally wrong” to limit the intake to a few hundred refugees, while SNP chief Nicola Sturgeon called for Westminster “do more."    Sutherland called for Britain to play a greater role in forging a united European effort to end the “appalling suffering.”    "I think that this country can do more,” he said. “The only way to solve this problem is by a united European response and that means sharing responsibility for appalling suffering. This is a humanitarian crisis that Europe has not experienced in our time of a dimension, which demands a common response. At the moment it is true to say that a number of countries are massively bearing the burden of this.”    SEE ALSO:  Drowned Boy Sums Up 'The Syrian War In One Photo'  How The Graphic Image Divided Britain's Press  PM Refuses To Budge On EU Refugees 	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Paul Vale	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/02/david-miliband-germany-response-syria-refugee-crisis_n_8080310.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

MORE 'BAKE OFF':   'Bake Off' Reaches New Heights In The Ratings  Did You Spot THIS 'Bake Off' Blunder?  Sue Perkins Reveals Heartache Over Dog's Death In Open Letter    The ‘Great British Bake Off’ star is set to get his Jeremy Clarkson on by fronting a special about Aston Martins.    The ‘Bake Off’ judge is a bit of an expert on the classic cars, as he owns his own £100K model.      Paul Hollywood    Paul landed the new presenting role following the success of ‘Racing Legends’ in January, which saw him interviewing his hero, motorsport icon John Surtees.      It is thought the new show will lead to Paul fronting more car shows for the Beeb.    A source told The Sun: “Paul is now one of the BBC’s most bankable stars, so they’d be mad not to make the most of his huge popularity.    “He has always been really keen to make motoring shows. He enjoyed making the Racing Legends programme, so he was open to new projects.    “Producers approached him about the Aston Martin special, which is very close to his heart, and after that’s in the can he will start coming up with more ideas for shows.    “If all goes to plan he’ll be one of the most regular faces on the BBC.”    Last week Paul denied claims by ‘Great British Bake Off’ hosts Mel and Sue that they had crashed his beloved Aston Martin into a ditch.    The mischievous pair claimed Paul had ‘the most spectacular sense of humour failure’ over the prank, but he later said they’d been telling ‘porky pies’.      The 'Great British Bake Off' gang    He tweeted Sue asking: “Morning Sis @sueperkins when did you put my car in a ditch???”    When a fan then asked if it was true, he replied: “Mel and sue ditching my car is a porky pie!!”    He later clarified: “They managed to move the car 50 yards 3 years ago at 5 mph !! How it ended up as a car in a ditch is a mystery!”         LIKE US ON FACEBOOK | FOLLOW US ON  TWITTER 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Matt Bagwell	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/03/paul-hollywood-car-show-great-british-bake-off_n_8080788.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

The presenter is set to swap hosting duties to take on the banker for the very first time in a bid to bag £500,000 for charity.      Noel Edmonds and Sarah Millican    And Noel was just as much in the dark about competing on the show, which has already been recorded, as the ‘Deal Or No Deal’ audience.    Shortly after kicking off the special episode, comedian Sarah Millican appeared from the wings and announced she would be taking over hosting duties.    Noel then found himself competing to win £500,000 for his chosen charity, Children’s Hospice South West.    Speaking about the special episode, Noel said: “To be given the chance to play the game I am so very proud to host was a great honour and one of the biggest shocks of my professional life.     “I hate the Banker even more now! Playing for Children’s Hospice South West - a charity very close to my heart - was the icing on our 10th birthday cake."    The mysterious Banker added: “Noel was speechless when he realised he’d been pranked by the one true talent of the show, yours truly.    “Where have the years gone? I look withered, Noel looks years younger. That tells you a lot about who does all the hard work around here. I would say it’s been a pleasure, but it hasn’t.”    You can find out how he does when Channel 4 airs the charity special on 18 September.

MORE 'CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER':  Seven 'CBB' Housemates To Face Eviction This Week  Chloe And Stevi Have Their First 'CBB' Row  'CBB' Slammed For Airing Footage Of Janice Dickinson Having A Fit    Janice Dickinson is this year’s biggest earner, pocketing £300,000 for her stint in the Channel 5 reality house, according to The Mirror.       Janice Dickinson has been paid three times more than any other star    The paper claims to have obtained details of how much bosses have forked out on each star.    Tila Tequila was set to pocket £110,000 for the series, but it’s said she won’t receive any of it, after being removed from the house after less than 24 hours, for pro-Nazi comments she posted on Facebook prior to entering the house.     The Playboy model is apparently contesting the decision, threatening to sue the show unless she is paid.     Bobby Davro and Natasha Hamilton are each earning £75,000 for the series, while ‘X Factor’ rejects Chloe Jasmine Whichello and Stevi Ritchie are said to have been paid a “six-figure sum to share between them”.     But after the pair’s latest rows, we’re not sure how long that relationship is going to last…      Natasha Hamilton has reportedly been paid £75,000    Details of the other housemates’ earnings have not yet been revealed.     However, the stars’ payouts are all markedly less than the reported £400,000 bosses splashed out on both Katie Hopkins and Katie Price to take part in the last series in January.     A Channel 5 spokesperson told HuffPost UK: "We don't comment on the confidential business affairs of housemates."     ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ continues tonight at 9pm on Channel 5.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 03:57:00	The Waugh Zone September 3 2015	        The five things you need to know on Thursday September 3, 2015...            1) WAKE UP CALL    The tragic, heartbreaking photo of little three-year-old Aylan Kurdi on that beach in Turkey has prompted some real soul-searching across Europe about the Syrian refugee crisis. And it’s notable that that word ‘refugee’ is being used increasingly rather than ‘migrant’. Of course, border polices say it’s often difficult to distinguish between the two, but no one’s doubting that Aylan (who died with his brother and mother) was from Kobane in Syria and his family fleeing the awful conflict.    The pressure on David Cameron to take more Syrians is now growing. Tory backbenchers David Burrowes (in the Telegraph) and Johnny Mercer and Tom Tughenhadt (both ex-military) point out many of their constituents feel the same way. Yvette Cooper has written a letter to Cameron overnight to say: “You are very mistaken if you think that people across Britain do not want us to do more to meet our moral responsibilities.” Andy Burnham has called for an urgent Parliamentary debate next week.    So far, the PM is not budging. In fact there’s a major PR effort to point out just how much financial support the UK is giving (Andrew Mitchell notably helping out, stressing that the UK has given “more than whole of rest of EU in terms of financial support” for those in refugee camps.) Some in Whitehall were stung by the Washington Post’s claim that the 200 or so Syrians accepted by the UK could fit into a Tube traion. But the PM’s words yesterday - talk of keeping the situation ‘under review’ - allowed him enough wriggle room for a One Nation style gesture to show he’s listening. One option could be the council route. The Conservative leader of Kingston upon Thames council, Kevin Davis, has already written to 50 Tory-led councils asking them to become involved in a scheme run by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, to help find private housing for refugees for a year. Could that be the way for No10 to come out of this with its reputation enhanced, not damaged?    The Times quotes Sir Mick Davies, the head of Mr Cameron’s Holocaust Commission, saying that Britain had a “moral imperative” to help refugees seeking sanctuary and must not “shut itself off” from modern crises. Tim Farron in the Indy says it’s time to act.    As for the EU politics of all this, No.10 will be pleased Merkel has not directly linked the renegotiation with the crisis. But the FT reports on how tricky things are diplomatically. During the negotiations on relocating 40,000 refugees earlier this summer, one EU diplomat said British officials joked that they would take zero people “and double that if they were really pushed”. That’s a joke that has curdled with time. Don’t forget too that the French are softening on the issue. Manuel Valls. announced a plan to build a permanent camp in Calais, mirroring the similar centre in nearby Sangatte closed in 2002 by Sarkozy.    Sandro Gozi, Italy’s secretary of state for EU affairs, told Today that many countries including the UK could and should be doing more. Note his irritation in the FT, telling Theresa May not to lecture the EU over Schengen: “If you decide to stay out, opt out, you relinquish your ability to shape policy”.       2) JEZ HESITATION    Yvette Cooper’s strong line on Syria (she’s been talking about this since for years, don’t forget) has impressed many Labour members. But is it too late to affect her hopes of clinching the leadership? Well, party insiders tell me that less than half of those eligible to vote have yet done so and when you add in the 120k ballots that only went out last Friday, you can see why the Cooper camp are saying it ain’t over. Indeed, the Guardian reports one Cooper source criticising Chuka Umunna for talking prematurely about how to deal with a Corbyn leadership. “He is giving the impression it is all over and [that] anyway a Corbyn victory is not too much of a problem.”    Patrick Wintour also reports that party officials and PLP chair John Cryer have concluded that plans to ‘box in’ Corbyn by restoring Shadow Cabinet elections would require a special conference - and the unions won’t back the change unless Corbyn wants it (he has backed off the idea in recent weeks).    The Burnham camp are also confident they can snatch victory. Burnham is interviewed by Andy Grice in the Independent and his camp claims one in five Labour members and supporters previously committed to Mr Corbyn is now undecided. “The choice is stark now,” Mr Burnham said. “I think people attracted by what Jeremy has said have held back, worried by what it would mean and whether it would work.” Gricey also gets a great line from Burnham on the welfare bill vote: “If I had resigned, I might have won the contest there and then,” he said. “But it would not have been me. I would have won it under false pretences.”    The Telegraph has Corbyn allies saying what many cooler heads have assumed: the leftwinger would not push big issues like Trident or Nato. One source says: “It is bloody obvious. If he wants to avoid being smashed by the Parliamentary Labour Party, the government and the press he needs to avoid those issues. He should prioritise things that will unify the party – blocking welfare reforms, austerity cuts, protecting workers rights.    The Sun keeps up its pressure, getting Vernon Coaker to denounce quotes its dug up from Corbyn questioning why our military is so big. And in the FT, economists have written a letter denouncing Corbynomics. George Magnus and Kitty Ussher are among them - but many academics have opted out of signing.    The spectre of deselection of 'right' wing Labour MPs looms again too, in another 1980s throwback. Editor of LeftFutures Jon Lansman floated it on Newsnight and Channel 4 News's Michael Crick got an unnamed Unite figure to warn deselections of named MPs such as Simon Danczuk and Heidi Alexander were on the cards. Team Corbyn will want to stamp out such talk quickly I suspect.      3) REFERENDUM BLUES    The Government’s decision to wait until the very last minute to table its EU referendum bill amendments hasn’t gone down well with some Tory Eurosceptics. Although David Lidington has moved (and won headlines pointing out this is a second concession in two days) to restore ‘purdah’, the grumbling is still continuing. Steve Baker tells the Sun: “This is not much further forward than we were three months ago”, whereas Liam Fox is in the Times warning ministers not to “manipulate electoral systems to their advantage”. First of all, it’s wrong in itself,” he said. “Secondly, any such manipulation would only lead after a referendum to allegations that it was rigged and would prevent us having any closure.”    The FCO may conclude that it can never win with some backbenchers. But its redefinition of purdah has already got Labour and some Tories nervous, as it can still allow activity that is not ‘directly’ linked to the referendum question. Labour hasn’t ruled out voting against this Amendment 35 on Monday, so it’s far from resolved.    There is a fresh concession from the Government that got overlooked yesterday however. Ministers have now backed David Nuttall’s amendment ruling out May 4, 2017 as a date for the poll. Eurosceps worry that holding the referendum on the same day as local elections would allow Cameron to get Tory activists to deliver ‘In’ campaign messages as well as election ones.      BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR...    Watch this melodramatic cat react to its owner’s smelly feet.       4) WAGES OF THIN    The Chancellor’s National Living Wage was unveiled with a flourish in his summer Budget but since then there’s been little analysis of just how much a difference it will make to millions of people. Today, the Resolution Foundation - the leftish think tank which originally called for a NLW - has a report out predicting that the direct and indirect impacts will be on 6m people, a quarter of the workforce. The ‘Ripple Effect’ is substantial.    And women are the big winners. Women are expected to account for 3.7 million of those receiving a pay rise – representing 61 per cent of the total and nearly three in ten of all female employees – because of their higher concentration among the low paid.     But Conor D’Arcy, the Resolution Foundation’s analyst, has also blogged for HuffPost UK on another projection he’s unearthed: the NLW will only mitigate 15% of the cuts to in-work benefits planned by the Government (and unveiled in the same Budget) for those in the bottom half of the income scale.       5) DEADLINE DAY    No, not the football one again. Midnight tonight is the deadline for Whitehall departments to hand over their cuts plans to the Treasury. The FT reveals that tomorrow the Chancellor will review just how ministers have responded to his calls for model cuts of both 25% and an eye-watering 40% as he looks to find savings of £20bn.    The FT quotes one Whitehall figure: “The Treasury is very bullish at the moment. There is a possibility that they won’t do what any departments say. They are now basically running all domestic policy.”    Sajid Javid is a willing axeman at BIS, it seems, slashing ‘business support’. There’s even revived talk of scrapping the department altogether and merging it with an energy portfolio. Vince Cable (remember him?) even pops up to warn the Government is shirking its responsibilities. This spending review is gonna be a biggie, that’s for sure.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 03:57:48	Drowned Syrian Toddler Photo Inspires Graphic, Bold Front Pages On Europe's Refugee Crisis	The photo that surfaced on Wednesday of a dead Syrian toddler, drowned and washed ashore yesterday as his family tried to reach Greece from Turkey, has moved the British press to level huge pressure on David Cameron to do more to to help refugees risking death for a better life in Europe.     Almost todays newspapers carried the moving image of the child, named in reports as three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, on their front pages, one commenting the picture was a "heartbreaking symbol" of a "crisis engulfing the continent".     Its publication sparked a heated debate over editors' and journalists' judgement for using the photo, but most figures supported its prominent publication, LBC host Iain Dale saying it was "not an easy thing to look at" but adding that he felt printing it was necessary because "it needs to be brought home to use what's happening".    The photo has provoked emotive responses from high-profile politicians and prompted several Tory backbench MPs to insist Cameron shift on his reluctance to accept more refugees fleeing war, destitution and human-rights abusing regimes.     Most widely applauded was The Independent, for its unedited presentation of Aylan's picture on its Thursday front page, captioned: "Somebody's child."     It claimed the Prime Minister was "in denial", the European Union was "in deadlock", and asked readers: "Do we really believe this is not our problem?"    Amol Rajan, the paper's editor, posted a picture of Thursday's splash in a direct address to the Prime Minister, saying: "David Cameron - right now you look heartless and out of touch. Show leadership: say #refugeeswelcome."    Warning: Graphic image displayed below    Dear @David_Cameron, right now you look heartless and out of touch. Show leadership: say #refugeeswelcome in Britain pic.twitter.com/WXXgYoacnr— amol rajan (@amolrajan) September 2, 2015      He spoke out again on Thursday morning, defending the move, after coming under some criticism.    Didn't go into journalism to put dead kids on front pages. Considered all arguments against carefully. Feel strongly this crisis warrants it— amol rajan (@amolrajan) September 3, 2015      Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon herself tweeted in approval of the way Aylan's photo was carried, heralding the paper's "heartbreaking and powerful" front page.     Somebody's child. A heartbreaking and powerful front page. We must do more @David_Cameron https://t.co/eIVWd4tTJR— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) September 2, 2015      Stig Abell, managing editor of rival publication The Sun, also posted a comment in support.    The Independent front page tonight by @amolrajan is powerful, unsettling and terribly sad. pic.twitter.com/jO0s3ZRrZS— Stig Abell (@StigAbell) September 2, 2015      The paper included the photos of both Aylan, and newborn 'Hope', a baby born to a Syrian refugee mother in a "filthy" subway next to the main international rail terminal in Budapest, Hungary, where 2,000 other asylum seekers were camped after being denied access to trains bound for Germany.     The Sun editorialised "our nation has a proud record of taking in desperate people and we should not flinch from it now if it is beyond doubt that they have fled for their lives".         Other newspapers also featured the shocking image, some opting for a separate, less graphic photo, which shows three-year-old Aylan being carried away by a Turkish police officer, his face obscured by the man.    The Metro carried the less graphic photo, captioned "Europe could not save him".        The Mirror decried the picture as "unbearable", commenting that it was "the heartbreaking human face of a tragedy the world can no longer ignore".        While the Times led on EU leaders who have been left split over how best to tackle the continents migrant and refugee crises, headlining their photo: "Europe divided."        Other newspapers, including the Guardian and the Daily Mail, both carried the more conservative image and urged readers to comprehend the cruel reality of a crisis engulfing Europe.     The Mail, which has often towed a hard-line stance on immigration to the UK in recent years, released a notably sympathetic front page captioned: "Tiny victim of a human catastrophe."         While The Guardian described it as: "The shocking, cruel reality of Europe's refugee crisis."         The Daily Telegraph chose not to feature a picture of Aylan, instead opting for a photo of a Mcedonian police officer carrying a crying child, while crowds of refugees wait behind the country's barbed wire border with Greece.    Although the haunting image was featured prominently on Thursday, it was the the less than sympathetic and Ukip-backing Daily Express who ran instead with "EU blamed for migrant chaos", picturing migrants in Southern Europe trecking across a railway line.         Many veteran politicians united on Thursday, in light of the picture surfacing, calling on the Prime Minister to be "realistic and practical" in the face of a mounting continent-wide crisis.     Baroness Warsi, a Conservative peer and former Foreign Office minister, said Britain should "share the burden" of refugees fleeing Isis held territories in Syria.     She claimed Britain had a long-held history of accepting refugee children, citing the country's welcoming of Jewish infants in the run up to and during World War Two.    She joined two Tory backbench MPs, Jonny Mercer and David Burrows, who called on Cameron to shift his hardline position.    Burrowes said the UK "should accept thousands, not hundreds" of people while Mercer claimed that mothers trying to keep their children afloat on life jackets should not think of the UK as a place that did not welcome them.

READ MORE:   Cheryl Delivers Some Devastating 'X Factor' News About Dannii  Comedian Katherine Ryan Takes Aim At Cheryl  Cheryl Defends Grimmy From 'X Factor' Fan Backlash    The ‘X Factor’ judge has been hit with negative comments about her appearance on the latest series of the ITV talent show, but while she admits they don’t bother her, she is worried about the effect they are having on other people.       Cheryl Fernandez-Versini    In an interview with ES magazine, Cheryl said: “I can take whatever they [the press] throw at me after 13 years, what worries me is what it’s doing to the younger generation. And some of the people writing this stuff are women. There is no sisterhood.     “The body shaming has to stop. It’s bulls***. Something has to be done, changed, even if it’s done in law.”    Despite being labelled too skinny by body-shamers, Cheryl insisted she is “very happy and very healthy”.    “Every woman has a different body type and handles stress and grief differently,” she explained.     “I was a ballerina from a child, so I have really good muscle memory. When I work out, I can look like a tennis player. If I don’t, I look different.”    When Cheryl first hit out at comments about her size in July, she stated that she had been affected by the death of her father-in-law.     In an Instagram post, she wrote: “I am so sick and tired of it being ok to call somebody too thin or a ‘bag of bones’.    “I would never dream of calling somebody too fat and that they should maybe cut down on their food intake? What is the difference?    “You have no idea what I have been through. Just losing my father in law v recently and everything that comes with that. Not that I am or should justify myself to anyone.”    She continued: “I’m so f sick of people thinking it’s ok to be mean or body shame anyone. And it’s woman on woman. Have some respect and maybe think there may be reasons why before opening your mouth please.”      Cheryl launched an Instagram rant about her weight in July    Simon Cowell later defended his co-star, telling The Sun: “This is not someone who’s trying to make herself thin. I think she did pick up a bug.    “And I think the way she’s approaching what was addressed about her weight in a very open way - by saying she is thin and is trying to put on weight - is great. I don’t think she would have done that two years ago.”         LIKE US ON FACEBOOK | FOLLOW US ON  TWITTER 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Ashley Percival	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/03/cheryl-fernandez-versini-weight-body-shaming-illegal_n_8081102.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 05:03:07	Great British Bake Off 2015 - Week Five	Episode 5 is 'Free-From Week', and the contestants have a series of challenges where they must bake without some of the most common kitchen ingredients. Presumably, this is in an attempt to show us viewers at home that there's life after gluten, that sugar-free doesn't equal taste-free, and that dairy isn't a necessity. Therefore, what the program makers probably didn't want was the opening scenes featuring Tamal with a look of disgust on his face as he stirs an unappetising-looking brown concoction. "This... is... rank", he confesses to the camera.    The VT to start the show also focuses on Ian's incredible record of three consecutive weeks as star baker, and the challenge the others face to get to his level. "All the other bakers want to break my fingers," he cheerfully retorts, and you get the sense they wouldn't exactly lose much sleep were he to have a kitchen disaster. Is this unusual beginning foreshadowing what's to come, or is it merely a red herring?    The signature challenge is a sugar-free cake, and our remaining eight must find something else to sweeten their sponges. Most of the bakers go with either agave syrup or honey, but Nadiya has decided to get the sugary hit in her blueberry and caraway crunch cake with mulberry molasses. Tamal proves his medical credentials by using syringes to inject grapefruit and blood orange syrup into his honey polenta cake, and Mat's got so much filling in his carrot, date and honey cake, it's a wonder there's any sponge at all.    Usually, a portent of bad things to come on Bake Off is someone making a cake so simple that they've finished well ahead of time. Today that's Alvin, whose tried and tested pineapple upside down cake is ready so early that he has time to clean his entire workstation and make himself a brew whilst everyone else rushes around him. However, his cake is a winner, as is Paul's carrot, pecan and agave creation. Less lucky is Ugne who, despite everything looking hunky dory to begin with, finds that her chocolate, hazelnut and agave cake (which is also gluten-free) has a structural mishap just before the judges appear. However, there's some succour for Ugne, and she can't hide the delight on her face when Ian's pear, ginger and honey cake is proclaimed to be "stodgy".    Paul Hollywood sets a technical challenge of a dozen gluten-free pitta breads. In fact, it's as if he doesn't realise that a prime-time television show needs a bit more spectacle than some amateur bakers staring at a proving draw before turning out some dull, oval flatbreads. I say 'oval' because, well, everyone knows pitta breads are oval, don't they? Everyone, that is, except Alvin, who has apparently got to the fifth week of Britain's most competitive baking show without the faintest idea what a pitta bread looks like. First he ponders whether they're triangular and when it comes to rolling them out, he stares at the ceiling whilst muttering aloud, "Circle? Oblong? Circle? ...Oblong?". In the end, he has a crisis of confidence and dodges the question altogether by basically just making plain naan breads.    Unsurprisingly, Alvin finishes bottom, just behind Tamal who, with 23 minutes to go, was still considering giving his raw dough a second prove. Nadiya, however, who has come in the bottom three of every technical challenge thus far, completely storms it and wins the round, ahead of Paul in second and Flora in third.    Ahead of this week's showstopper challenge, Paul Hollywood shouts, "We expect to see magic in the tent!" as if he's just realised the last challenge may well have lost them a million or two viewers. Our heroic octet have four and a half hours to make an ice cream roll, with the stipulation that the ice cream must be dairy-free. Many of the bakers circumvent this lactose-limiting law by cracking out the tins of coconut milk leading, naturally, to a handful of them picking tropical-themed desserts. In fact, both Paul and Ian are making their very own 'dessert islands' with sculptures and a beach theme. Ian's palm trees are very impressive indeed, but Paul spends a little too long sculpting the individual parts of his bikini-clad marzipan woman. You get the impression Paul's practised that quite often.    As you'd expect, having to make their own ice cream is proving quite the challenge, but perhaps not for the reasons you might think. For viewers hoping for some kind of melting-based schadenfreude or a scandal to rival last year's Baked Alaska-gate, there's nothing of the sort, as all the ice cream emerges from the churning machines pretty much as planned. What is a problem, however, is wrapping the sponge around it, due to the quantities they've made. Alvin's got so much of his buko pandan (Filipino coconut) ice cream left over that he's offering it round to his fellow contestants, and Tamal also struggles to encase all his ice cream, cracking his sponge in the process.    While Alvin's pitta blindness in the last round was surprising, it's nothing compared to Paul Hollywood's bafflement at Ugne's flavour combinations. When she announces she's making peanut butter ice cream and teaming it with grape jelly, Hollywood shoots her a quizzical look and offers his reservations that those two things might not work well together. Oh sure, Paul, I mean, peanut butter and jam are only one of the world's most popular sandwich fillings, that's all. Ugne's real mistake, though, is to try and put her jam inside the ice cream rather than around it and, as a result, it comes out looking like a sloppy mess. A very tasty sloppy mess though.    Elsewhere, the judges don't seem particularly bothered that Flora has entirely ignored the brief and made a chocolate and pear bûche (you may notice the words 'ice', 'cream' and 'roll' don't feature anywhere in the name of that dessert), and Mat's sponge is rolled so tightly he's managed to force all the ice cream out of one end. Ian, who, according to the judges, was "in danger" following the technical challenge, crafts a mango and stem ginger ice cream roll that MezBez says is "ingenious", and Nadiya gets plenty of plaudits for her freehand piping and mousse that runs down the centre of her chocolate, strawberry and lime dessert. It's a high standard; all three challenges had the potential for utter disaster but everyone's made a decent fist of it. Who can they send home?    Innuendo of the week: "Facing me, I've got a bit of a crack". Mary seems to be having some kind of horrific flashback whilst judging the ice cream rolls. It's best not to dwell on these things, Bezza.    Star baker: Not Ian! Nadiya's really pulled it out of the bag this week and she's a very deserving winner. She breaks into tears whilst imagining how proud her family will be of her accomplishments.    Going home: Ugne was bottom of a strong bunch and in the end, her over-ambition was probably what did it. Attempts to pack in multiple flavours and techniques meant that her bakes this episode were a bit... gloopy.    Next week: The super seven tackle pastry. Cue endless remarks about 'soggy bottoms'.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 05:04:14	Don't Overlook Young People Who Have Learned Their Skills the Hard Way	I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that I know what it feels like to live in a workless household, I don't. I've never had to make big life decisions without a family to support me, and have never had to leave a job I love through illness - but I do know what it's like to grow up in a dysfunctional home.     I look back on my childhood and can remember witnessing domestic violence like it was yesterday. I know all too well how the effects of this, along with many other issues, can be far reaching and destructive. That's one of the reasons I support youth charity The Prince's Trust, because they do understand those issues, and they work with affected young people to find solutions.     I'm lucky, I've had many roles throughout my career and know how rewarding doing a job you love can be. I always wanted to do well, and I worked hard to get to where I am today but it's the support I get from my amazing family that keeps me going. They're there to pick me up when I'm having a bad day. They're there when I make the wrong decisions, when I'm trying to balance my home life with work or when I need to overcome a setback. With their support, I learn new things about myself and others every day, and over the years have built up the knowledge I can use to help others achieve their dreams. I know not everyone is as fortunate as me.           Now, I'm known for my music career and for being a judge on TV talent shows. When I'm judging, I look for the hidden talent, the thing other people have failed to notice, and am always honest with people. The contestants on Britain's Got Talent know they are entering a contest and will be subject to scrutiny, but for many young people across the UK, being judged isn't something they choose. It's something that happens to them, and they often feel powerless to change it.     Young people in difficult circumstances learn the hard way how to be resourceful, to communicate under pressure and to negotiate. The sad thing is their valuable skills often go unnoticed because people don't take the time to look past the surface, jumping to conclusions about them before they ever have a chance to impress. If someone is unemployed, it's all too easy to assume they don't want to work, when in reality they don't have a job because they've been looking after siblings or caring for an ill parent.     The Prince's Trust understands the challenges facing disadvantaged young people, providing practical support that helps them realise their potential and get their lives on track. As an Ambassador for The Trust, I've been fortunate enough to meet some of the young people they've helped and have seen how the right support and encouragement can transform lives.          One of those young people is Claudia Konda, who I met recently while she was taking part in The Prince's Trust Team programme - a 12-week personal development course supported by Barclays that helps young people gain the skills and confidence they need to move into work, education or training.     Claudia's world was turned upside down when she lost her Mum ten years ago. She soon found herself looking after her two younger siblings, having to stay strong for their sake no matter what happened. Claudia cared for her brother and sister through thick and thin, looking after her sister when she was ill with tuberculosis. All the while, she'd been suffering with clinical depression, which was only recently diagnosed.     The pressures of daily life were a lot for Claudia to handle and her studies fell by the wayside as she struggled to keep her family afloat. She was frustrated because she knew she wasn't reaching her full potential, and knew that if she wanted to keep supporting her siblings and be a good role model for them she had to get her life back on track.           Just like many of the contestants I've seen at auditions, all Claudia needed was a chance to shine, and The Prince's Trust Team programme gave her that opportunity. Despite having to move into a refuge just a few days before the programme started, Claudia stuck with it and the transformation in her is amazing. While learning new skills and getting the emotional support she so desperately needed, Claudia became even more determined to succeed. She was soon able to demonstrate all of her abilities and discovered a passion for working with young people who have autism while completing her work experience at The Aurora Centre.     Claudia continues to bring smiles to the faces of the people she cares for at The Aurora Centre by volunteering there. She's also going to study for a higher education diploma in social work in September to build on the skills she's learned so far, and ultimately wants to help other people by working in educational psychology.     Claudia is a truly inspirational young woman and just one example of someone who has the ability and desire to work, but just lacked the confidence and skills to get her foot in the door. How many other young people are there out there in the same situation? With support and encouragement of organisations like The Prince's Trust, all young people can have a brighter future.     I've worked as a judge, but I always strive to look for hidden talents. I urge you not to judge young people before you've given them a chance to be their best self.    Alesha Dixon's new album 'Do It For Love' is out on 16 October    The Prince's Trust is celebrating the 25th year of its Team programme, which is supported by Barclays and has helped more than 187,000 young people move into work, education or training since 1990.

This time, it's over the music video for her latest single, ‘Wildest Dreams’.    READ MORE:  The Stars Really Came Out In Force For The MTV VMAs  Miley Sticks Her Oar In Over Nicki Minaj VMAs Controversy  Taylor Swift And Lisa Kudrow Just Sang 'Smelly Cat' And Now The World Is Complete    The new clip sees Taylor portraying a 1950s movie star, on location in the African continent.    However, the video has been met with accusations of racism, with some critics claiming that Taylor is glamorising colonialism by setting the video in that period and landscape, and only using white actors.      Taylor Swift in the 'Wildest Dreams' video    HuffPost US writer Lauren Duca said of the video: “Instead of the cultural appropriation that has become almost status quo in today's pop music, Swift has opted for the bolder option of actually just embodying the political exploitation of a region and its people.”    Similarly, American radio station NPR have published an essay condemning the clip, writing: “We are shocked to think that in 2015, Taylor Swift, her record label and her video production group would think it was OK to film a video that presents a glamorous version of the white colonial fantasy of Africa.    “Colonialism was neither romantic nor beautiful. It was exploitative and brutal. The legacy of colonialism still lives quite loudly to this day.”    Perhaps anticipating a backlash, a message at the end of the video - which also features shots of African wildlife - reads: “All of Taylor’s proceeds from this video will be donated to the wild animal conservation efforts through the African Parks Foundation of America.”      Taylor and a lion    While Taylor is yet to publicly acknowledge the backlash, the video's director Joseph Kahn has attempted to justify the video, by revealing that one of its producers was black (and, evidently, "super hot").

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 05:37:47	How to Protect Yourself Against the Hackers	The number of data breaches has continued to grow in 2015. Barely a day goes by without a company or country falling victim to a cyber-security attack. Some of the high profile attacks we've witnessed this year include Github, Uber, and Chris Froome's personal training data. These attacks, amongst others, demonstrate the vast scale of the problem that so many have had to deal with and others fear will happen to them.     But behind the headlines - which often focus on which celebrity pictures have been leaked, or whether America suspects Russia or China is to blame - the message is clear: hackers are still one step ahead of many organisations' security procedures.  In spite of this, there are ways that companies and individuals can protect themselves in order to level the playing field and ensure hacker dominance is short-lived:    • Sharing is key - Becoming a victim of a cyber-attack can be devastating for any company. Not only can it put sensitive data in the hands of the wrong people, it can have a damaging effect on its reputation with customers. But in order to get ahead of the hackers, organisations need to work together to keep them out. This means sharing information about types of attacks, defence tactics and best practices.     Recently, the US Congress passed legislation to legally protect organisations that share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures to help encourage such practices. The two bills drafted this year offer liability protection for companies that share cyber threat indicators with the government. These types of measures are essential because they encourage knowledge sharing between companies, whilst protecting them from liability, under current law, for divulging details of a cyber-attack on their organisation.     • Education for all - The best way to combat a recurring problem is to increase awareness and educate people about why it happened in the first place. Companies should therefore take the time to share usage best practices at a customer and employee level. Security risks are often a result of employee or customer mistakes or actions. But this doesn't mean the onus is only on them.     As a company, it is your duty to have policies in place to educate your staff about security. Sometimes cyber attackers will use a method as simple as sending a piece of malware in an email - as we saw with the Target data breach. But as hackers become more sophisticated, educating employees needs to go beyond better password management. Think about how users are authenticated to use the network for example, and how easy it would be for a hacker to breach. Login processes that require two-factor authentication can add an extra layer of security to accounts with users logging in from remote locations. Although you may have protection around company data inside the network, employees might choose to use their preferred cloud applications to manage work documents, which may operate outside IT jurisdiction, putting your data at risk. Ensure you have a policy in place which specifies which applications employees are allowed to use or even better, implement a system that manages and secures the identities of users, rather than every device they use to access the network. Most importantly, explain to staff why these measures are important and what they can do to help, encouraging their contribution and compliance in maintaining security.      • Have a plan - If experience has taught us anything, it's that anyone can fall victim to a cyber-security attack. There's no excuse then for a business not to have a security plan in place and arm themselves with the latest technology - such as encryption, DDoS mitigation techniques and protection for critical apps.      Recent research revealed that over half (54%) of businesses lack security intelligence to protect against cyber threats. Six in ten IT decision makers also lack complete confidence in their company's cyber security policies. Organisations need to act now and put a plan in place if they haven't already, and ensure they're investing in the right technologies to protect their business and data.    A change in how we handle and look after information, whether as individuals or businesses, is inevitable. This might be due to a behavioural change caused by a massive or highly damaging hack that effects a large amount of people - for example, the UK's connected heating devices being hacked in the middle of winter. Alternatively it'll be institutionally-driven change - 2015 is likely to see the introduction of the new EU Data Protection legislation, having implications for the ways in which data is collected, stored, accessed and secured by organisations. Regardless, businesses shouldn't sit still and wait for one of the above. Instead, they should take the lead, implementing their own policies and security infrastructures. Doing so can help us all get ahead of the hackers.

The 20-Year-Old Syrian Refugee Who's Depending On His Education To Save Him	In a photo taken on Friday, Hussein Al-Shamali, a 20-year-old, from the northern city of Idlib in Syria, held up his school identity card which has become one of his most prized possessions.    The graduate, who was resting after crossing from Serbia to Roszke, Hungary, protects his valuable card with a plastic carrier bag. Along with the card he carries in his backpack, is his academic transcript and the second-level certificate he earned in science.       In his backpack, Hussein carries what he hopes is the key to his future: all the records of his learning.      Al-Shamali, who studied three years of civil engineering, hopes he will be allowed to pursue a postgraduate degree in medicine once he reaches Germany.    "I really do not know what they will think of my school work. I hope it will be enough," he told the Associated Press. "Many people have spent thousands of dollars on me, to get me this far.    "I have to give back. It is expected of me."      Al-Shamali hopes his school work "will be enough"    In another picture, taken on the same day, Wafaa Bukai, 25, a student from Damascus, Syria, holds a photograph as she waits for her brother to cross the border from Horgos, Serbia to Hungary.      Wafaa Bukai, 25, a student from Damascus, Syria    Unlike many trekkers, who carry precious photos only electronically on a mobile phone, Bukai thumbs through her personal album of childhood images, including her pre-teen self in school uniform and trips with family to the beach.    The photographs emerging from the refugee crisis, including one of a drowned toddler who was washed ashore as his family tried to reach Greece from Turkey, has prompted both the British press and public to pressure David Cameron to act.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 05:55:30	Refugee Crisis: Online Petition Reaches 100,000 Signatures Needed To Trigger Debate In Parliament	An online petition calling on the UK government to accept more refugees has topped the 100,000 signature threshold needed to force a debate in Parliament following a massive surge in support.    About 100 people a minute were signing up to the Government e-petition this morning, fuelled by the picture of a three-year-old boy washed up dead on a beach after attempting to escape Syrian.     UPDATE:   His Name Was Aylan Kurdi   Heartbreaking Cartoons Capture World's Sadness Over Drowned Syrian Boy      The shocking image was shared across social media yesterday and featured on the front page of most national newspapers this morning.    Signatories had reached 105,000 by 10.55am having only got to 16,000 before the picture emerged yesterday.     Meanwhile, acting Labour leader Harriet Harman is writing to David Cameron calling for an emergency COBRA meeting in Whitehall and a summit of EU leaders to deal with the crisis.    A Labour source said: “David Cameron must now stop dragging his feet. It is high time Britain starting living up to its international responsibilities and proud tradition of helping those who need it most.”     MPs from across the political divide have called for the Government to do more to offer refuge to those with genuine asylum claims, with Tory backbenchers including Johnny Mercer and David Burrowes heaping pressure on David Cameron.    Shadow Home Secretary and Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper yesterday called Britain's asylum policy  "immoral" and said that if every town in the UK accepted just 10 families each, then the UK could offer nearly 10,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees a place to live in peace and safety.    She compared the idea to the 1930s programme which saw Britain take in 10,000 Jewish children fleeing the Nazis in the matter of months. Labour leadership rival Andy Burnham has called for a Commons debate too.      MPs who decide what is debated in the Commons are not obliged to grant a debate, but the groundswell of outrage would make it very difficult to deny.    The UK government has come under fire for not sharing the burden of refugees fleeing war zones and dictatorships compared to EU counterparts.    SIGN PETITION HERE    The refugees petition is getting about 100 signatures a minute. It's about 27,000 short of forcing MPs to debate: https://t.co/Xovy5VoB6s— tom_watson (@tom_watson) September 3, 2015      The petition, under the headline 'Accept more asylum seekers and increase support for refugee migrants in the UK', reads: "There is a global refugee crisis.    "The UK is not offering proportional asylum in comparison with European counterparts. We can't allow refugees who have risked their lives to escape horrendous conflict and violence to be left living in dire, unsafe and inhumane conditions in Europe. We must help."

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 06:06:54	Tory MP Philip Davies Slams Woman's 'Pathetic' And 'Trendy Left Wing View' Over Refugee Crisis	A Conservative MP has called a woman "pathetic" and accused her of having a "trendy left wing view" in an argument over the refugee crisis.    Philip Davies, who represents Shipley in Yorkshire, wrote that Britain cannot "a never ending supply of people into the UK" while net migration is 300,000 a year, three times the level David Cameron has committed to bringing it down to.    After Amy Firth called his position "cold" and asked if the emails were spoofs, Mr Davies replied: "It is frankly pathetic to suggest that you can only show you have compassion by thinking we should take everyone who wants to come here."    He added: "I see that you subscribe to the trendy left wing view that what is important is looking compassionate whether it is really compassionate or whether it is sensible.    "If you want to think that you have a monopoly on compassion which can only be shared by people who agree with you then that is your prerogative."    Philip Davies told the woman, whose mother is his constituent, that her argument with him was 'pathetic' and she subscribed to a 'trendy left wing view'    The email exchange occurred earlier this week before the image of a drowned Syrian child piled pressure on British politicians to do more to help refugees. It began when Ms Firth's mother Janet Cavanagh used a Refugee Council petition that auto-generated an email to Mr Davies, her MP.    It asked him to "call on the Prime Minister to lead Europe by responding compassionately and ensuring that saving lives is central to any response" and push for Britain to offer thousands more refugees a place here.    Mr Davies replied, saying refugees should always seek refuge in the first safe country they arrive in and Britain "met its obligations and should always do so".    He wrote: "Therefore, there is no justification at all for people entering the EU via the Mediterranean to enter the UK. I am not sure on what basis you know that all those entering the EU are fleeing persecution and are not illegal immigrants."    Ms Firth then took up the exchange on her mother's behalf, writing to the MP: "I am disappointed but not surprised to hear such a cold response. Rather than pursue the most likely pointless task of trying to help you develop some compassion for your common man."    SEE ALSO: Hundreds Of Brits Are Pledging To Offer Their Homes To Syrians   Drowned Syrian Toddler Photo Inspires Graphic, Bold Front Pages On Europe's Refugee Crisis  David Miliband Lauds Germany's Response To The Syrian Crisis    She then lambasted his assertions that Britain should only accept refugees it was obliged to.    "Just because I don't believe that the UK can take in every refugee and illegal immigrant who is trying to get into the EU does not mean I think what is happening is tragic and it is frankly pathetic to suggest that you can only show you have compassion by thinking we should take everyone who wants to come here," Davies' final email read.    "I will stick to dealing with the real world knowing that countries should stick to their international obligations as we do and knowing that we cannot take everyone in the world who wants to come here.    When asked to confirm his choice of words, Mr Davies said he had "probably" used them and he stood by his comments that Firth's comments to her were "pathetic".    He told HuffPost UK: "She had asked me for my views. I replied faithfully... she launched a tirade of abuse. I absolutely stand by that. When you say I'm lacking compassion because I don't agree with you... I would argue that level of debate is frankly pathetic."    When asked whether MPs should speak to voters like that, regardless of how they had spoken to them, Davies said he had given an "honest answer", adding: "I think that's what the public want from politicians."    Ms Firth told HuffPost UK: "People are emotional about this and MPs need to be aware of that. My response back was quite hard but it was in response to what we felt was a response that lacked compassion."    She added: "It is completely untrue to say I launched a tirade of abuse at him. There was disappointment, dismay and disbelief that an elected member of Parliament would speak to a constituent in such a way on such an important issue, but no abuse.    The fact that Philip Davies prefers to keep hurling abuse at me rather than commenting on the ongoing tragedy speaks volumes about this government."

READ MORE:  Katie Hopkins Isn't Impressed With David Beckham's Dummy-Gate Reaction  Katie Hopkins Can Even Turn A-Levels Into A Vitriolic Bile Fest  Lord Sugar Blasts Katie Hopkins Over Controversial Cilla Remarks    On several occasions, such as a ‘This Morning’ debate with ‘X Factor’ singer Katie Waissel, the ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ runner-up has publicly admitted her disgust at body art, and said she would never hire anyone with a tattoo.    During an appearance on Irish TV this year, Katie told a tattoo artist: “As an outsider, not many people think that looks good. And I would worry as an employer, not many people would want to employ you because of how you made your body look.    “How on Earth are you going to get yourself back to normal?”      She's only gone and got a tattoo    That’s why we were surprised to see that Katie recently went under the needle herself, as part of her new TLC show, ‘If Katie Hopkins Ruled The World’.    In this week’s episode, Katie debates the pros and cons of having a tattoo, and admits that to properly explore the argument, she should get one for herself, as suggested by her guest Kerry Katona.    So what did Katie go for in the end? A tribal pattern at the base of her spine? ‘Love’ and ‘hate’ on her knuckles? A full floral display on her posterior, à la Cheryl Fernandez-Versini?    Well, no. In fact, Katie’s new body art reads simply ‘Don’t Get A Tattoo’.      Wow    Having now got a tattoo of her very own, though, Katie is unrelenting in her attitude towards body art, insisting that if one of her children were to come home covered in tattoos “they wouldn’t be coming in my house”.    So what she's saying is, tattoos as self-expression are totally wrong. But tattoos as a publicity stunt for your panel show are a whole other story...    ‘If Katie Hopkins Ruled The World’ airs on Thursday night (3 September), at 10pm on TLC.

And on Wednesday, they sent a very clear message to Apple while unveiling their flagship Mate S phone at this year's IFA tech conference.    How much does it weigh? Use #ForceTouch to find out #HuaweiMateS #IFA2015 pic.twitter.com/fxfRKGFyxz— Huawei Device (@HuaweiDevice) September 2, 2015      Huawei took aim at Apple by making direct comparisons between its new Mate S and the iPhone 6s Plus in a demo that reportedly involved the use of an Orange (no points for guessing why) to show off Mate S' pressure sensitive technology.    By placing an orange on the Mate S screen, Huawei was able to reveal the fruit's exact weight -- 280g to be precise.    Unsurprisingly, the smartphone-maker did not repeat the experiment using apples -- presumably the fruit is just too close to enemy lines.     Their message will not be lost on Apple, who are rumoured to be including Force Touch technology in the new iPhones set for a big reveal next week.    SEE ALSO  Apple Watch Review: Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood  The iPhone 7's Display Could Be Pressure Sensitive  iPhone 6 Made Apple More Money This Quarter Than Any Public Company In History    Apple first unveiled Force Touch in its smartwatches last year. It's a type of technology that allows you to choose a range of different actions depending on the pressure applied to the screen.    For Mate S, the varying degrees of force administered will allow users to zoom in on pictures or preview photos stored in the gallery.        Its Knuckle Control 2.0. option also enables you to action various features on the phone, including activating the camera by drawing a "C" on the screen using your knuckles. Not sure, why we would prefer knuckles over fingers but maybe this will start a new trend.         According to Engadget, Huawei CEO Richard Yu also told attendees the Mate S takes less time to charge than the iPhone 6 Plus.     It also has a 5.5-inch screen -- a reduction from Ascend Mate 7's 6-inch screen that launched last year -- and a 13-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation.    Huawei appears to have also thought of its selfie loving customers, adding a front light to its 8-megapixel front camera to help make your pout Instagram worthy.    "Every business when they start has the ambition to be number one, but to be number one is a challenging task," Shao Yang, veep of marketing told the Huffington Post UK last year.    He adds: "We think if we can keep making better innovations than others we can finally be the best."    It's hard to tell if Huawei very public challenge will win over Apple customers but one thing is for sure, the mobile phone market is now more of a fruit salad than Apple would have wanted it to be.

READ MORE:  Myleene Klass Lands 'X Factor' Job?  Myleene Speaks Candidly About Her Divorce For A Second Time  Myleene Klass Has Her Own Unique Take On Chef's Whites    The TV presenter blasted the site for taking down a clip of her appearing with three topless women from Mogmog Island in the Western Pacific.    The 37-year-old is currently on the island filming a new documentary called ‘Singing In The Rainforest’, which will see her composing music with the indigenous tribe.      Myleene Klass    After the video was removed twice from her official Instagram page, Myleene hit out at the site for censoring the image.    "Twice this has been removed!” she wrote. “This is not offensive, derogatory to women, sexually explicit.     “It's 3 (amazing) women teaching me what their ancestors taught them, a song about being fearless for a programme aimed not only for us to musically collaborate but to equally celebrate and learn from each others cultures."         These women are amazing as they are and proud of their bodies as they feed and raise the children on the island and are free and beautiful. Sadly our culture sees something wrong with this and my pics have been removed. It is natural, not sexual or offensive. Please when you watch #SIngingintherainforest, tape up the upper half of your tv so as not to feel shock at what every second person has...a brain. A photo posted by myleeneklass (@myleeneklass) on Sep 1, 2015 at 10:57am PDT      On her third attempt, Myleene posted an image of her with the three women, but chose to cover their breasts with stars.    It’s not the first time Instagram's censorship policy has caused issues for users of its site.    Topless images of women are regularly removed from the site, including breastfeeding pictures.    The Free The Nipple Campaign, which is supported by the likes of Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus, has long campaigned for Instagram to change it's policy when it comes to female nudity.

While you’d be forgiven for thinking that the cast might take their foot off the pedal following a busy and action-packed summer, for many of them, the drama is just getting started.     At an 'EastEnders' press event this week, bosses teased what’s coming up on the soap this autumn. Here’s what to watch out for in Walford during the coming weeks…     1. Kathy Beale’s return        We’ve been waiting for this moment ever since live week, and now, Gillian Taylforth’s character is finally set to come face-to-face with the people of her past - and some new ones who don’t exactly take a shine to her.     There’s also the small matter of her husband Gavin, who is being touted as the soap’s “most dangerous villain ever”. (Yes, we are genuinely a bit scared.)    2. Phil discovers Ben and Paul’s affair    Ben Mitchell and Paul Coker’s secret tryst sparked a number of Ofcom complaints earlier this year, and the storyline is set start more conversations, when Ben’s dad Phil discovers his son’s secret.     When the hardman catches his son in a, shall we say, comprising position, Paul then cracks a joke, proving he’s one of the bravest men on the planet, let alone just in Walford.     3. Max Branning’s murder trial         It’s been a long time coming and a resident of Albert Square is finally set to appear in court, where they stand accused of murdering Lucy Beale. Only, as we all know, Bobby is actually guilty. Will the truth ever be revealed?     Bosses are remaining tight-lipped on the jury’s verdict, but our sneak peek revealed that there are plenty of twists and turns to come. Lauren Branning is set to return for her dad's court appearance - and give birth while she's in Walford! - while Abi will take to the stand and give evidence, along with Lee Carter.     Meanwhile, Jane will reveal the truth about Bobby’s deed, to a person outside the Beale family. Is this Max’s way out? Watch this space…     4. Maria Friedman’s back!     Oh, Elaine, we’ve missed you. Linda Carter’s mum, played by stage legend Maria, will once again grace Walford with her presence, and she won’t be arriving alone. This time around, she'll have a new toyboy lover, played by Scott Neal.     5. Lee Carter’s depression         The ‘EastEnders’ team have showcased their ability to tackle sensitive issues brilliantly over the last 12 months, with storylines such as Linda Carter’s rape scene and Shabnam and Kush’s stillbirth tragedy being handled sensitively and appropriately. This autumn, they’ll tackle male depression, as Danny-Boy Hatchard’s character continues to battle the mental illness.     See all the latest ‘EastEnders’ news and spoilers here.

Deleon Alonso Smith, suffered the fatal blast to the throat a day before he was due to start community college.    The father-of-two was reportedly taking pictures with his cousin before the gun discharged in what appears to have been a tragic accident.       Deleon Alonso Smith fatally killed himself whilst taking a selfie    A police statement read: “According to a witness, the victim was handling a gun he believed to be unloaded.     "The gun then discharged and the victim was struck in the upper body. The investigation is continuing, with no charges filed at this time."    Smith's devastated uncle, Eric Douglas, spoke to local news and said: "It's the worst feeling in my life, it's a numb feeling. It's still unbelievable."    The victims grandmother Alma Douglas told the station: "Yesterday was my birthday and he came to wish me happy birthday, and then to hear this kind of news..."    The pair reportedly found the firearm on the same day of the fatal selfie.    No information has been provided on who may have owned the gun.

Funny to remember how Eileen lectured Brandi about not using that word . . . doubt she's having that same conversation with her bestie Lisa! And Lisa is cranking up #AlltheDrama even offscreen these days!! We learn this episode that apparently, after Adrian's ostentatious Beverly Hills party, Lisa sent a threatening text to Kim!! Ladies, save it for the cameras! Lisa, I thought you were a seasoned pro - if you are going to pull some entertaining crazy like that, please wait until next season so we can all enjoy! #SavetheDrama Kim, if you go missing, we'll all know it was Lisa, with the candlestick, in the library! #Clue    Lisa turns on the waterworks during this confrontation, but it's hard to believe tears from a woman who cries for a living. Ladies and gentlemen, don't let the alligator tears fool you! . . . Unless she really is that upset?     Onto the next match. Oh yes, let's re-trace our steps to Amsterdam please! #SpaceCake #ContactHigh Let's also not forget that Brandi used this trip as an opportunity to expose Kyle and their pot smoking ventures in the past. #narc Lesson learned here: don't smoke pot with a frenemy who has the potential to out you publicly. Brandi wanted to make a point that Kyle is a hypocrite. Well done, Brandi. I was very entertained to find out that fact! Who would have thought? #PoshPot    Brandi VS Kyle: Space Cakes in 'Dam // The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills // Season 5        Kim's sobriety has become the hot topic again. And the most confusing part of the season to me. If you relapse are you sober? If you show up on camera in the beginning of the season, "high as a kite" when you are supposedly sober, people are going to talk about it. Especially around new cast members who have never met you and are ready to dig in.    Now for the final round of this #FamilyFeud!! This entire season has been a threesome between Kim, Kyle, and their new BFF Brandi. But it's not as sexy as you would think!! I never saw this coming!    Brandi hasn't helped the sisters' relationship, but she isn't really responsible for the rift between them either. Obviously the sisters, like any, have some deep-seated issues. Maybe Brandi and her antics were the straw that broke the camel's back. But if anything, I think Kim has been hiding behind Brandi to avoid more confrontations with Kyle. I also think Kyle is just sick of Kim's antics. It's probably healthy for them to take a break and step back from their intense on-camera relationship, which seems to heighten everything.    Apparently, a big part of their rift has played out over Instagram. Allegedly, Kim's dog bit Kyle's daughter, resulting in a hospital visit. Kyle says that her daughter nearly lost her arm! That's intense. But still, I can't even believe when Lisa Rinna is coaching Kyle from the sidelines, saying, "Stay strong!" as Kyle tearfully addresses her sister. Really?! And then maybe her best quote of the night: "You need to own that dog bite." LOL!    I'm not a fan when Kim (or anyone) says, "There are circumstances that have happened outside of the show that have affected our relationship." We deserve to know what happened! We don't watch your lives every week so that you'll leave out the most important parts that affect your on-camera drama!! Hello, this is not a puzzle, it's a reality show!! At this point, I want them to bring Kathy Hilton on the show more than ever. I think everything will make so much more sense when we get to hear her point of view.    I do hope the sisters can find their sisterly love again. Nothing is more important than family. In Lisa Vanderpump's words, they need to "put a lid on it "and just be there for each other at this point in time and resolve their issues. #lifestooshort    I do believe Brandi when she says she wants the sisters to fix their relationship. Emotions are running high as the episode starts to reach that point of saying goodbye. Thank you, Brandi, for all your entertainment and time on the RHOBH! You will be missed!    Warning: Spoiler Alert:  Final Episode     On our final episode of the season, secrets will be revealed!! We will get some never-before-seen stories as the Beverly Hills vault is opened. I have never seen this episode myself, so there is not much to spoil our next installment of #AlltheDrama. I can't wait!!!

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 07:13:30	Motorola's New Moto 360 Isn't One Smartwatch, It's 300	Motorola has unveiled the new Moto 360 for 2015, a slimmer, more powerful smart watch that runs Android Wear, comes in a staggering 300 variations and is available this month.    The company has opted to offer the 360 in three variations, Male, Female and Sport. Each version then comes in two sizes - 42mm and 46mm.      Moto 360 comes with over 300 different design variations.    The new Moto 360 has been given a major overhaul over its predecessor. First up is the software. Yes it’s still running Google’s software Android Wear but Motorola has given the way you interact with it a serious tweak.    The clock face now has a number of interactive complications which allow you to perform quick actions like Shazam a song, check your fitness levels or see the weather.    Think of it as a hybrid between the Apple Watch’s complications and its Glances.      Each 'complication' on the watch face can be tapped on and engaged with.    That screen is now going to look a lot more like a clock as well thanks to a new 1.3-inch AMOLED display that boasts 236ppi.    Battery life has been given a small but helpful improvement to 1.5 days during normal use to 2 days if you’re feeling particularly anti-social.      The Moto 360 Sport comes with Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS.    The smart watch features Bluetooth and WiFi, so while you won’t be able to use the Moto 360 as your new shiny contactless wallet you will be able to use it on WiFi even if your phone dies.    On the surface this might seem like a minor update and indeed the hardware has been given what appears to be a significant but expected upgrade.     Where Motorola is clearly hoping to gain dominance is in its personalisation features. With three different versions of the watch and countless colours and strap designs the plan is clearly to go with customisation over kudos.        That’s not to say the new Moto 360 isn’t a looker, indeed just like its predecessor, the new version features a precision made design using aircraft-grade aluminium and high-quality leather.    Surely this comes at the cost of something? Well yes, the cost. The Moto 360 starts at £229, which while cheaper than the entry-level Apple Watch, is still considerably more expensive than its Android Wear rivals.    The Asus ZenWatch 2 costs considerably less than £200 while Huawei’s own smart watch is expected to reach a similar price point.    Of course with the news that Android Wear now works on iOS, Apple finally has competition and the new Moto 360 appears to be just one of the new frontrunners that’ll be vying for the early-adopting market.

READ MORE:   Jake Roche Slams 'F***ing Idiot' Zayn Malik  Perrie Breaks Down Mid-Song During Little Mix Live Show  10 Celebs Who Handled Their Break-Up Like A Boss    The Little Mix singer, who split from fiancé Zayn Malik last month, was unrecognisable as she wore full body paint as part of her striking costume on the ITV2 comedy panel show.     Posting a snap of herself on Instagram, she wrote: “Cheetahhhh! @heidiunlik3ly You're insane! Thanks for painting ma bodeh!”        Meeeow!

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 07:40:12	Ricky Wilson And Nicole Scherzinger To Lead New Panel Show ‘Bring The Noise' - Will It Be The New ‘Never Mind The Buzzcocks'?	‘The Voice’ judge Ricky Wilson and former ‘X Factor’ panellist Nicole Scherzinger are set to team up for a new panel show, ‘Bring The Noise’.     The programme will air on Sky1, with Ricky as the host, and Nicole and Tinie Tempah as team captains, alongside comedian Katherine Ryan, and you’d be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu at the show’s format.       The show will air this Autumn    While ‘Bring The Noise’ will feature live performances, the show will welcome celebrity guests, and feature music trivia rounds, funny videos and games. Yes, it’s basically a way snazzier version of ‘Never Mind The Buzzcocks’.     Ricky and Nicole have a tough task on their hands if they’re hoping to fill the void left by the once glorious BBC panel show, but it seems that they’re up to the challenge.     “Nicole, Tinie and Katherine are all completely brilliant and ridiculous in equal measure,” Ricky explains. “I'm no stranger to music based TV shows with a competitive element, but this is taking music TV to another level. Swing by the off licence, phone for a takeaway, and settle in with ‘Bring the Noise’."    "I'm so happy to be involved in this exciting, new, multi faceted show - it's like nothing out there,” adds Nicole. “I'm looking forward to letting loose, sharing some hidden talents and just having some fun!"    ‘Buzzcocks’ was cancelled earlier this year when ratings hit an all-time low, but the show was once hugely popular with TV and music fans.     ‘Bring The Noise’ certainly has a huge task on its hands if the team are hoping to provide us with golden moments akin to Preston from The Ordinary Boys throwing a paddy and storming off, and the wonderful Amy Winehouse, offering the best Tim Westwood anecdote in the entire world.     ‘Bring The Noise’ will air on Sky1 this autumn.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 07:44:02	Idris Elba Responds To Anthony Horowitz's 'Too Street To Play James Bond' With The Perfect Instagram Post	Idris Elba has responded to recent comments made by ‘James Bond’ author Anthony Horowitz, who suggested he was “too street” to play 007.    READ MORE:  Pierce Brosnan: 'James Bond Will Be Black Before He's Gay'  Daniel Craig Unshaken, Unstirred In New 'Spectre' Images  David Oyelowo To Play James Bond - Only We Won't Get To See Him...    Earlier this week, Anthony - whose first Bond novel ‘Trigger Mortis’ is released next week - was met with a backlash over his remarks, when he suggested that the ‘Luther’ actor was “street”, rather than suave.    Ironically, Idris has now responded to the criticism as suavely as possible, with a subtle dig on his Instagram page.        Always Keep Smiling!! It takes no energy and never hurts!  Learned that from the Street!!    #septemberstillloveyou A photo posted by Idris Elba (@idriselba) on Sep 1, 2015 at 3:30pm PDT        Posting a screengrab of the headline ‘007 Writer Says Idris Elba Is ‘Too Street’ To Play James Bond’, he added: “Always Keep Smiling!! It takes no energy and never hurts!     “Learned that from the Street!!”      Idris Elba    Nicely handled, Idris.    Idris was named as a potential successor to Daniel Craig in leaked emails from Sony, although some critics (namely, y’know, racists) weren’t happy to see a black actor in the pipeline to play James Bond.    At the time, Idris hit back at the negative comments about him, with a mocking post on his Twitter page, joking: “Isn’t James Bond supposed to be handsome? Glad you think I’ve got a shot.”    Anthony Horowitz has since apologised for his comments, admitting that his choice of words had been “clumsy”.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 07:55:53	Migrant Crisis: Daily Mail And The Sun Blasted For 'Sheer Hypocrisy' Over Drowned Aylan Kurdi Front Page	Tabloid newspapers are being hounded by thousands of social media users for their sudden and apparent u-turn over the migration crisis that is sending tremors across Europe.     Thursday's editions of almost all the nationals splashed on an image of deceased toddler Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned during his mothers' plight to reach Greece from Turkey by sea.    Pictures of the boy were printed by two tabloid papers, complete with messages urging Prime Minister David Cameron to change tack over his refusal to match pledges from other European leaders to take in swathes of desperate asylum seekers fleeing their war-torn home nations.     The Daily Mail accompanied its front-and-centre picture of deceased Aylan with the caption: "Tiny victim of a human catastrophe".     Warning: graphic images below      But many people were unimpressed with the Mail's heartfelt front page, calling its sympathetic message "sheer hypocrisy" in the light of previous splashes and editorials.    I have to be professional but oh god that Daily Mail front page and just the sheer hypocrisy of it.— Keith Stuart (@keefstuart) September 2, 2015      without acknowledging the climate THEY've helped to cultivate in the first place with anti migrant, super nationalistic rhetoric— Cal Mcl (@CalsHungry) September 3, 2015      @footyramblings @chunkymark @DailyMailUK Is there no end to Daily Mail hypocrisy? Have they no shame?— The Kettles2 (@thekettles2) September 3, 2015      One person pointed out a drastic change in the paper's tone, highlighting the marked difference between Thursday's front page and that published less than a week before, in a post that garnered over two-and-a-half thousand retweets.     The earlier story focused on statistics issued by the ONS that showed net migration to Britain had hit over 330,000 - the highest figure on record.    But the Mail's front page just six days later, laden with a sympathetic picture showing Aylan's body, bemoaned him as a victim of the "migrant crisis engulfing Europe".     Six days apart. Go fuck yourself @DailyMailUK pic.twitter.com/q8RgsmfLOw— JW (@footyramblings) September 2, 2015      The Sun also came under fire for an apparent u-turn, hundreds of social media users lambasting the paper for having published sinister comments by its famed and contentious columnist, Katie Hopkins, in light of its editorial this week.    Hopkins wrote in The Sun in April: "NO, I don’t care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad.    "I still don’t care."    Readers repeated her words back at the newspaper in light of Thursday's tragedy and accused Sun editors of "playing high horse in a crisis".      The Sun. Demonises and dehumanises refugees and migrants for years. Sees public opinion change. Publishes this. Scum. pic.twitter.com/ZGvFIqDNG0— Dave Gould (@davesgould) September 2, 2015      Tabloids create public fever to the point the PM thinks it's bad PR to help children, then play high horse in crisis pic.twitter.com/hbtRGqzRW7— Tom Wilson (@feedthedrummer) September 2, 2015      Surprisingly Sun front page tomorrow. Hypocritical, blood on their hands scum they are, but its a step up in the pressure on Cameron.— Seaneen Molloy-V (@ms_molly_vog) September 2, 2015      The racial bile spewed by the Sun & Daily Mail has influenced govnts to reject refugees. Their change of heart appears hollow & hypocritical— David Cairnduff (@atDuff) September 2, 2015      The backlash came as an online petition calling on the UK government to accept more refugees has topped the 100,000 signature threshold needed to force a debate in Parliament following a massive surge in support.    About 100 people a minute were signing up to the Government e-petition this morning, fuelled by the picture of a three-year-old boy washed up dead on a beach after attempting to escape Syrian.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 08:06:44	New Maths Course Will Teach Students How To Split Bills And Take Out A Mortgage	From compound interest at your bank to working out how to get the best money exchange rates, a practical maths qualification has been released by an exam board - after compulsory financial education was introduced last year.    OCR's "Level 3 Core Maths" course, ready to be taught for the first time this month, ends years of tedious maths lessons which focused on maths problems which were often not applicable outside the classroom.    School’s minister Nick Gibb explained: "Maths skills aren’t just used in the classroom - they are vital in everyday life, whether you are running your own business or trying to pick the best mortgage."    He added: "This one nation government is giving our young people the opportunity to develop the practical maths skills which will help them succeed."      A sample paper from OCR’s website. Can you work it out?        Eddie Wilde, OCR's head of maths, had previously argued: "Mathematics plays a vital part in the life of each individual and contributes significantly to the economy of the country."      Now available to any students who achieve at least a C in their GCSE maths, DfE (Department for Education) claims to aim the exam at “those students who would not normally study maths at A level or AS level but need maths skills in further study which could include courses like economics, geography or social sciences".    A number of large businesses praised the new course, with managing director of Brompton Bicycles Ltd saying: "Maths runs through our organisation; design, purchasing, budgeting and profit and loss. It affects all areas HR, Marketing, Logistics, ICT, not just those that are perceived to be mathematical like finance or design."

So when HuffPost live's Josh Zepps asked him about the funniest thing in the universe, the answer he got came as something of a shock.    According to Tyson, the funniest thing in the universe is the slow and utterly surreal death that comes from entering a black hole.    SEE ALSO:  These Terrifying Science Fiction Weapons Actually Exist  Physicists Prove Universe Is Just A Computer Simulation  Are Comedians Funny Because Their Brains Are Different?  Tractor Beams Are No Longer Science Fiction    Turns out that entering a black hole results in some fairly odd things happening to your body. Things are rearranged, removed and downright evaporated in a manner that would bring tear to the eyes of even the steeliest resolve.    Don't panic though, our very own Professor Stephen Hawking has come to the rescue with a new theory which suggests there might (and this is a fairly massive might at that) be a way to escape a black hole.        The renowned scientists believes that black holes actually store the information of ourselves on the rim of the event horizon, potentially allowing information, and us, to escape.    Of course Hawking couldn't just give us all good news hypothesising that where we re-appear could be in an entirely different universe.    Helpful.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 08:23:40	'Terrifying' Case Emerges Of A Boy 'Too Young' To Be Revenge Porn Victim, So Instead Criminalised For Snapchat Selfie	A case where a schoolboy was "humiliated" and deemed a criminal after a naked selfie he sent to a girl was circulated around his school has been dubbed "terrifying" by lawyers.    However, if the teenager had been 18 or over, he would have been a victim of "revenge porn", and those who forwarded on his image would have been prosecuted.    The 14-year-old has had his details added to a police intelligence database after police decided he had been making and distributing indecent images.    Although the boy has not been formally charged, his details will be stored for up to 10 years, although has not been charged, after the incident was flagged to his school's police officer. The girl who circulated the image, which was sent via Snapchat, has also had her details added to the database.    Claire Gill, a partner at law firm Carter-Ruck, told The Huffington Post UK the case would "terrify" parents and children alike.    "Were these children adults, both the boy, and the girl who sent on the image of the boy to her friends, could face prosecution," she said.    "Education, not criminalisation, is the best way to stop children disseminating sexual images of each other. It is about teaching children about the harm and distress that can be caused by circulating these images on social media, and making sure they understand the risks with the technology and social media platforms.     "Most kids who do this do so without thinking about any of the consequences."    Gill added: "This boy has learnt his lesson the hard way."    The mother of the boy, who lives in the north of England, was told by a police officer the incident could be flagged up in a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check if her son ever wanted a job working with children.    Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said her son who was "at best naive, at worst just being a teenager", had been "humiliated".    Jessica Taplin, CEO of Get Connected, a youth charity providing free helpline service for under 25s, said the neither teen should have been criminalised.    "Common sense has to prevail and it has not in this instance," she told The Huffington Post UK. "Demonising a young teenager for experimenting and taking a photograph of himself and sending it to a girl of a similar age, who he no doubt 'fancies' seems to me incredibly knee jerk and unhelpful.    "The boy has made a poor decision, but ultimately he is also the victim, having to deal with the subsequent bullying & embarrassment caused by the dispersal of the image around his school and community."    Taplin continued: "The age of consent laws are there to protect children, they are not there to prosecute under-16s who have mutually consenting sexual activity.    "There is a very big difference between this sort of exploratory behaviour and the sort of behaviour that warrants police intervention.    "The school and police should be attempting to protect the boy by ensuring the image is deleted, and educating his peers so they do not share such images because of the pain and hurt it can cause."    Last year, a similar case made headlines when a schoolgirl received a police caution after texting an explicit photograph of herself to her boyfriend, and he forwarded to his friends after they rowed.    Police were called in because both were under 18 and so were committing an offence of distributing an indecent image of a child.    Taplin called for the decision to be overturned, adding: "The real danger behind sexting is what it can lead to for the children involved - bullying, anxiety, abuse, intimidation and isolation, there a causal links between these issues and acute problems such as anxiety, depression, self-harming or suicidal thoughts.     "Rather than penalising children who are attempting to “mimic” the over sexualised behaviour of society around them, surely we need to address the question of why has “sexting” become such an issue for today’s young people."    The boy in question, who asked to remain anonymous, said he knew some people at his school still had the image, and he felt "embarrassed and a bit intimidated" by how the police and his school had dealt with the image.    He told Radio 4: "It is just annoying really. Something that I did when I was 14 that could reflect badly in the future."

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 08:37:39	Refugee Crisis: George Osborne Says UK 'Will Go On Taking People' As He Blames Isis And Criminal Gangs For Shocking Death	George Osborne has held Isis and criminal gangs responsible for the death of a drowned three-year-old boy attempting to escape Syria as he said the UK "will go on taking" refugees.    Pressure on the Government to accept more asylum seekers has been fuelled by the shocking image of Aylan Kurdi  shared across social media yesterday and featured on the front page of most national newspapers this morning.    The Chancellor argued the root of the refugee problem stems from the instability in conflict-wrought countries, adding the first stage is to "tackle Isis [Islamic State] and the criminal gangs who killed that boy".    He pointed to the £1 billion of aid spent on helping "desperate people" and 5,000 Syrian asylum seekers resettled  since the start of the conflict, but hinted more could be done as he suggested the situation was under review.     Speaking to Sky News, Mr Osborne said there is no person who would not be "very shocked by that picture", but added:   "We know there is not a simple answer to this crisis. What you need to do is first of all tackle Isis [Islamic State] and the criminal gangs who killed that boy, you’ve got to make sure the aid keeps coming.    "We’ve put £1bn of overseas aid in to help these desperate people. And, of course, Britain has always been a home to real asylum seekers, genuine refugees. We’ve taken 5,000 people from the Syrian conflict.    "We will go on taking people and keeping it under review. Britain has been playing a leading role and it will continue to do so."    UPDATE:   His Name Was Aylan Kurdi   Heartbreaking Cartoons Capture World's Sadness Over Drowned Syrian Boy      Labour's Yvette Cooper has claimed 10,000 people could take refuge in the UK and Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader has written to David Cameron saying an emergency Cobra meeting should be convened to agree a cross-government plan.    Tory backbenchers have even broken cover to express their discomfort with Britain's position, and more than 125,000 have signed a government e-petition demanding a Commons debate.    Critics have seized on a figure suggesting the UK has resettled just 216 Syrian refugees since the start of the crisis.    But that is under just one scheme, the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation programme, over ordinary asylum intake.    The Full Fact website says the UK has taken in about 5,000 Syrian refugees since 2011.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:23:24	Samsung's Unveils SmartThings Hub To Control Internet Of Things In The Home	To naked eye, it's a small white box that appears to be quite harmless. But Samsung's SmartThings Hub could be the device that takes over our homes and lives, in the best way possible.     Its capabilities include making your coffee before you wake up, setting your shower at the right temperature and letting you know if there's an intruder in your house while you are away on holiday.     The SmartThings Hub is Samsung's attempt to make our homes smarter by connecting mundane objects such as toasters and light switches to the internet -- the Internet of Things.         It works using a range of sensors, monitoring a variety of factors including moisture, movement, pets and people -- that's assuming your loved ones don't mind wearing a tiny prison-like tag.     The Internet of Things has been a much awaited carrot, temptingly dangled in front of us without ever letting us have a taste.    SEE ALSO:  What is The Internet of Things?  CES 2015: Meet The Unhackable Gadgets Battling The Brave New World Of The 'Internet Of Things'  It's the Next Big Tech Development - Are You Ready for the Internet of Things?  The Internet of Things - What's It All about?     Well, Samsung's latest offering is as close as we have come to taking a bite.    The carrot however, is an expensive one.      The hub costs $99 (£65) and if you want all the trimmings, you'll have to dig deep. Each add-on is priced at around £29.     How does it work?        As with all smart things, the hub requires an app, available from Apple's app store, Google Play and Windows store.    For each smart device, you'll need to tell the app your daily routine and what you would like your smart devices to do once you've left your house or gone to bed        Setting up the hub appears to be quite straightforward as it simply needs to be connected to the router using an ethernet cable.    The most important piece to Internet of Things puzzle, is of course the "things" or connected devices including smart door handles, coffee-makers, smoke alarms and light switches.     Samsung is not the first tech company, and it won't be the last, to make strides in this market.     In May, Google unveiled Brillo -- an operating system that will quite literally let you control the planet Earth, as long as it's connected to the Internet/Bluetooth/WiFi.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:41:40	Alfie Boe Makes Trumphant Return to Broadway	Alfie Boe first appeared on Broadway over ten years ago but he wasn't in a musical.  As a young opera singer recently graduated from the Royal College of Music and the National Opera Studio, Alfie landed the part of Rodolfo in Baz Luhrmann's Broadway production of La Boheme, earning a Tony award in the process.    Fast forward to 2015 and Alfie has now returned to Broadway in the only professional role he has undertaken in musical theatre: Jean Valjean of Les Miserables.  In the interim years, Boe has appeared all over the world in opera and his own concert tours but it is the role of Jean Valjean that made his name back in 2010.  Of course, the occasion was the 25th anniversary production of Les Miserables at the O2 in London and Boe went on to play the role in the West End for a period of six months the following year.  It was this that led to a frenzy of speculation about his possible involvement in the Broadway show when the revival was announced a couple of years later; the frenzy surrounding Boe's possible involvement dampened slightly when the role went to Ramin Karimloo but never really went away, hence the levels of excitement when it was announced earlier this year that Boe would take over from Karimloo (a neat turn around from Boe's London run as Karimloo took over there).  Fans of Boe and the show alike were curious as to why he hadn't taken the role on Broadway earlier but as he made clear when I interviewed him (click here) earlier in the year, he just hadn't been asked (he also has a ridiculously busy schedule).  Although Boe's appearance was hotly anticipated as one of the best Jean Valjean's this would be no walkover - Karimloo had been nominated for a Tony for his performance. Happily, Boe's return can indeed be described as triumphant as can be seen from this first night review.    Perfection or as close as you can humanly come to perfection is the only way to describe Alfie Boe's opening night performance in Les Mis Broadway. He seemed a little bit nervous at the very beginning but that quickly passed. When he first came on stage I was was very conscious that I was seeing Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean and that in itself was exciting but that quickly passed; at the end of the show I realised that at some point (I think when Alfie made his first appearance as mayor) I was no longer thinking in those terms. Instead I was watching Jean Valjean and not someone playing JVJ. It was an incredible performance.        Of course I expected the singing to be extraordinary and Alfie did not disappoint. He nailed every song and received a standing ovation for Bring Him Home. What took me by surprise was the absolutely brilliant acting. I was lucky enough to have front row seats and could see every expression crossing his face and there were many. From the anger at the injustice of his imprisonment to the tenderness displayed in the scene when he takes Cosette away. This scene touched me the most. Alfie was truly a father looking at his daughter and rejoicing in the life that would now be theirs. When he picked her up it was not just to dance with her. He tossed her in the air twice and caught her both times. And the expression on Alfie's face can only be described as a father looking with great love at his daughter. I wish I could have filmed that and replayed it here. It has to be seen.    Les Miserables is at the Imperial Theater, Broadway and Alfie Boe will perform until 28 February.    This review first appeared on www.thoughtsofjustafan.com.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:47:09	Jeremy Corbyn, Old School Socialist? Or Scandinavian Style Progressive?	Jeremy Corbyn is coming to a town near you and he's eating human babies. Once he's finished devouring the nation's infants he'll crash the entire economy, close the banks and light bonfires piled high with savers' cash, just because he can.     According to much of the mainstream media, Corbyn, who was initially cheerfully pilloried for his geography teacher appearance and apparently unfashionable opinions, is now the most dangerous man in Britain. It's official. A few months ago he was the rank outsider in the Labour leadership race and unlikely to cause too much concern to anyone, least of all rich and powerful establishment figures. Packed out rallies and extraordinary opinion polls have changed all of that.     Free from a fevered establishment closing ranks to keep out the bogeyman, the questions voters would probably most like considered answers to are: If Corbyn was ever to find himself in government would Britain be heading in an old school Cuban direction? Or would the change in style and policy feel decidedly Scandinavian? And, most importantly, just how bloody dangerous is Jeremy Corbyn?     Well, the first thing to note is that ideas like Corbyn's, a whole host of which would once have been considered part of the broad mainstream, are now presented by most media outlets as radical and seriously edgy. In recent decades, neoliberalism has become the only arena in which major political parties have permitted themselves to play. This paradox has seen advancements in social liberalism but social democracy itself has ceded so much ground to Hayek, Friedman and, latterly, Thatcherite-inspired economic thinking to be almost unrecognisable.     But are some of his ideas still pretty radical?     One of his more interesting suggestions has been for 'quantitative easing for the people,' a policy that would see extra funds for infrastructure, housing and investment on green friendly projects. The aim would be to breathe life into an economy that has seen the slowest recovery since the 1920's. QE to the tune of £375bn was, of course, used by the Bank of England in the wake of the financial crisis to pump money into a struggling economy and to prop up an ailing banking system. A wide range of economists with varying political views suggest that such a policy is certainly risky, and shouldn't be dismissed entirely - but whilst conceding that it would be most effective should the UK re-enter recession. Despite the tabloid frenzy around Corbyn's QE plan, it's hardly something new and Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has recently been advocating something very similar.     It will also alarm the alarmists that Corbyn, a man who has never hidden his distaste for the power of fat cats and major corporations, has been making overtures to Britain's entrepreneurs. He has promised tax cuts, a business rate freeze and rent controls as well as increased training support for small businesses. It all sounds eminently sensible so expect the reactionary tabloids to conveniently avoid any mention of this...    According to the Incomes Data Services report from 2014, directors at top 100 listed UK companies now earn an eye-watering 120 times more than the salary of the average British worker. Corbyn's stated aim of introducing limits on top company executive pay will find plenty of support among the voting public. It will also engender outright hostility from those living in gated mansions in stock broker belt Surrey.     While it's very difficult to imagine big business leaders doing cartwheels at the prospect of a Corbyn-led government, delving a little deeper into his economic policies suggests that interventionist, old-fashioned social democracy rather than doctrinaire socialism lies at the heart of the majority of his plans.     Another of the principal themes of his campaign has been the anti-austerity message. The argument against austerity has always been that government cuts are ideology driven and that ordinary people - the nurses, school teachers, librarians and dinner ladies didn't cause the financial crisis so why the hell should they have to pay for it? Particularly as those that did cause it have got away scot-free and have grown significantly wealthier. Despite such arguments being put forward, the Tory government with its state-shrinking ethos and backed, tacitly or otherwise, by the major media outlets and the electorate via a slim majority, appears to have won the debate in the short term. Obscurely, Corbyn has found an unlikely bedfellow in the shape of the fiscally conservative IMF. After advocating austerity in the early days of the financial crisis, the IMF's internal auditor recently disclosed that The International Monetary Fund ignored its own research and pushed too early for wealthy countries to trim budgets after the global financial crisis, thus stifling the pace of economic growth.     While the coalition and the current government have talked tough on tax avoidance and evasion, Corbyn is advocating a far more uncompromising attack on tax cheats. His estimate that the cost to the treasury is in excess of £100bn seems a little fanciful - most reputable sources suggest the public purse is being cheated out of a mere £30-£80bn. There will undoubtedly be support among the electorate for an end to scams that seriously harm the provision of vital public services but saying it is one thing, aggressively pursuing such a policy could prove more challenging and deeply bureaucratic.    Similarly, the reintroduction of a 50% tax rate for high earners is fine in principle but sometimes policies that are rooted in populism are difficult to deliver in practice. An awful lot of work would need to be done on tougher sanctions, closing the loopholes and on international co-operation on reporting systems. Otherwise, in many cases, the treasury could end up with 50% of nothing.     Corbyn has also been vocal about his desire to renationalise the railways and public utilities. Again, these are arguments that land well with a public sick and tired of profiteering by private companies but a serious amount of public money will be required to make such policies a reality. Successful implementation of QE and a massive overhaul of the taxation system, including higher corporation tax, would be required in advance if such bold ideas are to be economically feasible.     An area where Corbyn appears out of step with public opinion is immigration. He and many others have been absolutely right to express disgust at both the tabloid reporting and the prime ministers dehumanising language relating to the humanitarian crisis. Likewise, Corbyn's sentiments that Britain should do a lot more to help those fleeing persecution are entirely reasonable and will get a sympathetic hearing up and down the country. His apparent reluctance to fully accept the pressures on public services of excessive immigration, particularly in concentrated geographical areas, smacks of idealism, however well intentioned.    There are no such problems for Corbyn on foreign policy where, for many years, he's had an uncanny knack for calling it correctly. His passionate and courageous opposition to apartheid South Africa, the Iraq War, Libyan and Syrian airstrikes, together with long term dogged support for the Palestinian people in the face of Israeli aggression, has marked him out as a man who deserves a serious hearing. Often swimming against a tide of jingoism, his predictions of the madness that would fill the void left by western interference in the Middle East have proved unerringly accurate.    His personal view is that the UK would be better off out of NATO and as a non-nuclear state. It will certainly be a challenge to win over the British people regarding this perspective, but, putting things into context, countries such as Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland - collectively just about as extreme as the least extreme thing your mind can muster - do just fine with that international position. Maybe it really is time for Britain to shake off its imperial past and alter the global perception of the country. Such a move would also free up funds to invest in Corbyn staples like health and education.    So, based on all of that, what is the truth about Jeremy Corbyn? Is he the bogeyman depicted in the right wing media? Or are his ideas a viable alternative to a system that works very well for some but fails many others?     The striking observation when one takes the time to really dissect his policies are that they aren't anywhere near as radical as the hype would suggest. His central themes are for a mixed, interventionist economy, regulated to ensure market excesses are more evenly distributed for the benefit of all. It will probably disappoint those on the hard left and certainly a febrile, right wing media utterly immersed in neoliberalism and self interest but his ideas fit very snugly into a category that would once have been considered social democracy. His problem will be making himself heard over the background noise which is only going to grow louder.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:48:01	Student Horrified After Finding Hidden Camera In Shower At Travelodge Hotel In Oxford	A 23-year-old woman has been left feeling "absolutely disgusted" after discovering a hidden camera behind a shower vent at a Travelodge hotel in Oxford.     Harmony Hachey, a student from Edinburgh, was staying at the hotel with colleagues for a work event in the area last weekend.     She was using the shower cubicle when she noticed the device behind a vent. She pried the vent open with a fork to find a hidden webcam.      Harmoney Hachey, the student who discovered the hidden camera    The camera had been pointing directly where she had been standing naked in the shower just moments before.     Hachey told the Telegraph: "I was absolutely disgusted. I broke down at one point. I just felt so violated."    She added: "One of the girls had a shower and then I went in. It was the first thing I noticed. I was trying to convince myself I was crazy and it wasn't really there.    "I had my shower and I just carried on as usual convincing myself I was crazy. I was going through scenarios in my head."      The hidden camera that Hachey spotted inside the vent    When Hachey discovered that the camera was exactly what she thought it was, she took photos as evidence before bringing the camera to the attention hotel staff.     The manager of the Travelodge was called and he removed the camera. Hachey later received a call from upper management, who told her that the camera was there for maintenance.     Hachey said: "She told me to calm down and there was no footage on there. But no one had looked."    After unsuccessfully trying to find another hotel in the area for the night, Hachey was offered a room change and a full refund.      The Travelodge at Oxford Wheatley     Travelodge have offered their 'sincere apologies' over the incident.     A spokesperson told Huffington Post UK: "​We can confirm that on Friday 28th August 2015 a customer at our Oxford Wheatley hotel made us aware of the presence of what appeared to be a camera in their room.    "The privacy of our customers is a matter of the highest importance to us and the hotel team investigated immediately. While the camera appeared to be inoperative, we have reported this matter to the police and we are now supporting them fully with their ongoing investigations.    "We would like to offer our sincere apologies to the customer affected and will remain in contact with them to ensure the matter is resolved."    Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident and have confirmed that a camera was recovered from the hotel.     A spokesperson said: "We can confirm that we did receive a report of a webcam being found in a hotel room at Travelodge, Wheatley on Friday night.    "A camera has been recovered for examination. Reports of this nature are very rare, but we always treat them very seriously.    "We are working very closely with Travelodge to secure as much evidence as we can."

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:50:19	Why My House Has Gone to the Dogs (And Other 'Tails' of Woe)	It's been a while  since I blogged. The reason, dear readers, is this:         Daisy. (No relation of Kiss lead singer Gene Simmons, in spite of the tongue)      Yes, folks. A couple of months ago, we acquired a dog. A two-year-old boxer called Daisy, whose role was to shake our family out of its iPad-induced inertia, and get us out and about. Like the von Trapp family. But with poo bags.    But what we hadn't quite accounted for was the sheer magnitude of Daisy's walking habit.       The fact of the matter is that Daisy likes walking.  Daisy like walking more than Lord Sewel likes to wear orange bras and leather jackets whilst snorting coke off the chest of a prostitute. Daisy likes walking more than Gwyneth Paltrow likes to give her nether beard a good old steam clean. Daisy likes walking even more than she likes the smell of asshole, which, my friends, is saying something. All of which means I now spend seven hours a week walking Daisy, when I could be blogging, in addition to the three or four hours I spend walking her on weekends, with the family. Who now loathe me.     But it's not just the walking. In fact, following an epic walkathon around the village the other day (think Reese Witherspoone in the film 'Wild'),  I experienced a renewed sense of purpose that lasted for at least several minutes!! So the walking is almost invigorating. No, when it comes to Daisy, the straw that breaks the camel's back, or in my case, the increasingly obvious dowager's hump, is the extra cleaning.  The hallway, once a welcoming reception area with original feature tiles et al, now has the kerb appeal of a fucking squat. And every time we leave the house, which is never for longer than a couple of hours, we return to a river of glistening dog phlegm, the remnants of what was once an elegant Edwardian front door, floating through it, post-apocalyptically.        The front door. Absolutely fooked.          And then there's the smell that greets us on our return.  The smell of Daisy's separation anxiety. A putrid, gamy smell underscored by what can only be described as a lurid bass note of fear. Or, as Shakespeare might have put it, were he ever to come around for a cuppa, "Christ love, this is the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril".     "Get a grip Daisy!" I say, grabbing the mop, which I may as well wear around my neck on a chain, like old folks do with spectacles. "We were only gone for three bloody nanoseconds!"     She looks up at me lovingly, her whiskers festooned with chips of vintage anaglypta wallpaper, the masticated remains of period skirting boards glued to her lip.    "Oh what's the point", I say, patting her head.     On the plus side, the kids secretly love walking into the woods with her, even though they weep with a kind of biblical hysteria whenever I ask them to pause anything on 'You Tube'. They love, too, the deranged lopsided way in which she runs, and then runs some more; the excitement she demonstrates if you show her a ball; her ridiculously cute outsized tongue. And as a family we have gone to wild, remote places that we would never have usually gone to. Dunes. Forests. Mountains. Abandoned quarries. In short, she has forced us to see the world through a dog's eye, as a place of joy, and wonders, and immense possibilities. And for that I cannot thank her enough.    And if it means fewer blog posts while I get used to everything, then so be it ...

Viewed millions of times, the gaggle of ducks exhaling loudly in the bargain basket of a supermarket has been enough to make most of us really quite scared.    But others saw an amazing creative opportunity - by remixing the unmistakable drone with pop classics from Adele and Taylor Swift.    Adele      'Rolling In The Deep' is perhaps an obvious choice for the Duck Army's vocal talent.    Taylor Swift      'Trouble' seems to complement the Army's unique signature tones too. And they're surprisingly in sync with Swift's style.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 09:53:55	Tories Threaten the Right to Strike	A worker's right to withdraw labour is a fundamental one, recognized internationally for generations.  Indeed, the International Labour Organisation's Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention of 1948 was formally adopted by Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government of 1945-51.     It is the right to withdraw labour that maintains a balance of power in the workplace and it is this right that has given employees the ability to achieve better working conditions and better living standards for them and their families.      However, over the last 200 years Conservative governments have repeatedly sought to undermine this right and the current Tory government's Trade Union Bill seriously threatens it once again, attacking it simultaneously from numerous different directions.      Section 2 of the Bill introduces a 50% turnout requirement in strike ballots, whilst Section 3 goes further, setting an even higher bar in "important public services" where 40% of those balloted must vote in favour for a strike to be legal. That would mean, for example, that if 50% of members participate in a ballot, at least 80% of those who vote would have to vote in favour for a strike to go ahead.     The government argues that these measures are designed to improve workplace democracy, yet despite introducing stringent requirements on strike ballots, nothing is done to make the casting of a vote easier.  There will be no online voting - a measure which could bring ballots into the 21st century and genuinely facilitate wider workforce involvement - but rather, with Section 4 of the Bill the Tories make the requirements for paper voting even more onerous, including a need to have a "reasonably detailed indication of the matter or matters in issue".      The Bill also requires two weeks' notice of an industrial action be given to employers and combines this with restricting the mandate of any ballot to a four-month period.  Worse still, employers will be allowed to use this two-week period to arrange for temporary workers to carry out work during any strike.  The Tories propose to repeal Regulation 7 of the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 that prevents employers using agency workers to carry out "the duties normally performed by a worker who is taking part in a strike or other industrial action".      Pickets will also be more tightly regulated. Section 9 of the Bill requires that a "picket supervisor" has a letter of authorization and they must even wear "a badge, armband or other item that readily identifies the picket supervisor as such".  So ridiculous is the government's position that it even seeks to introduce a requirement for a trade union to publish plans in advance of industrial action which will need to state: "Whether it will be using social media, specifically Facebook, Twitter, blogs, setting up websites and what those blogs and websites will set out."  The idea that the position would not change during the notice period itself is absurd, yet on this logic any trade union would be restricted to saying what it had notified the employer beforehand: thus, the Tories are even trying to restrict what trade unions can say on social media, and are shamelessly cloaking this proposal in a document entitled "Consultation on tackling intimidation of non-striking workers."    No wonder the independent Regulatory Policy Committee has declared the Tory proposals "not fit for purpose".  They have no objective or reasonable basis. Let us not forget that the Tories also propose to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 - and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights includes the right to form and join trade unions to protect a worker's interests.      The right to withdraw labour is a basic one, but its existence depends upon workers actually being able to exercise it.  No government that claimed the mantle of "One Nation" could introduce such a divisive piece of legislation that is no more than a naked political attack on working people across the UK.

While we can’t stop the inevitable moment of realising you’ve spent half your student loan on junk food, we can help you save your money elsewhere.     With British railways the most expensive in Europe, one of the biggest hits to your wallet can be travel. There’s always a reason to travel; a lost love somewhere up north, friends at other universities where the nightlife looks slightly better, or just because you still don’t know how to use the university washing machines. Since no-one one wants to get themselves into debt over some dirty laundry, here are some tips to help you save money on travel:       	UK Universities 	Jordan Freud	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/03/five-tips-for-cheap-travel-_n_8082712.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-universities-education

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 10:01:44	Heartbreaking Images of Syrian Boy Drowned on Shore: PM David Cameron Must Act Now	As the images unfold of the reality of the refugee crisis, Europe is busy squabbling over numbers of how many people should be "let in". The heart- rending image of the little Syrian toddler washed ashore yesterday brought home the unprecedented tragedy and hardship that refugees are facing.     3-year-old Aylan Kurdi from the Kurdish-Syrian city of Kobane was believed to be one of at least 12 Syrians trying to reach Greece who died when their boats sank.     The young boy's father Abdullah Kurdi was the only survivor amongst his family having lost both his wife, Aylan and another son Galap from this tragedy. Despite the reaction worldwide there has been little show of change from European Leaders.     Justin Forsyth, chief executive of the charity  Save the Children, said the "tragic image" was a reminder of "the dangers children and families are taking in search of a better life, "This child's plight should concentrate minds and force the EU to come together and agree to a plan to tackle the refugee crisis," he added.      Forsyth is right, this child's plight is something that should bring it home to the EU. It is sad that it has taken a tragic image of the reality to get people talking about taking immediate action. However, if this image does not spur our PM to do something then nothing will.  What some people fail to understand is that we cannot even call these families and children 'migrants' as they are coming because they are fleeing oppression, they are trying to save their loved ones from tyrannical governments, war and bloodshed. Frankly, no one would be able to put up with the hardship that they have faced, given the years of war and turmoil that innocent civilians have had the brunt of in the Middle East.  All these people want is an end to living in fear, stability in their lives and safety for their kids. Is that really too much to ask?    Mr David Cameron, I urge you as a British citizen, who does not want to stand back and do nothing in the face of humanity, please allow these refugees the shelter and care they need.  We cannot sit back as a diverse nation in the UK and stay silent and we will not. We have to put ourselves in their shoes, as a parent of children, we want to protect our kids and give them a good life. What if we were fleeing oppression and were so desperate that we tried to enter into another country and were being refused? What if we lost a loved one from trying to escape oppression? Mr Cameron please think about this and take a leaf out of Germany's book.    Thankfully, our neighbours in Germany have set an great example  by welcoming Syrians giving them donations of food, toys and clothing and a warm welcome as they enter the country. Angela Merkel had pressed for new quotas on spread out the refugees in Europe and said, "Europe as a whole must move and its states must share the responsibility for refugees seeking asylum" .    Merkel further stated that, "Universal civil rights so far have been closely linked with Europe and its history it was one of the founding motives of the European Union," she said. "If Europe fails on the question of refugees, this close connection with universal civil rights ... will be destroyed and it won't be the Europe we want."       For the sake of humanity and with a compassionate heart I too hope that Europe will share their responsibility and that the UK will make a positive change in helping those who are in dire need of our help.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 10:04:42	Why an Aid Worker Is Embarrassed to Be English?	A British medic working with European colleagues for Medicines Sans Frontieres in the Mediterranean was interviewed on Radio 5 this morning and said she was embarrassed to be English because the UK is so reluctant to except more than a handful of refugees.    This is in contrast to Germany where they are likely to accept 800,000 this year and in contrast to the 11,000 Icelanders who have offered homes to Syrian refugees.     David Cameron has said "We think that the most important thing is to bring peace and stability to that part of the world," Cameron told the BBC. "I don't think that there is an answer that can be achieved by taking more and more refugees."    It is certainly unclear what steps he is taking to bring peace to Syria - and it was not long ago that the only thing he was proposing sending in were some additional explosives in the shape of missiles - this to a Country not short on explosives.    Of the four million refugees who have fled Syria - the UK has only formally accepted 216  - no wonder the aid worker feels embarrassed - not that someone doing her work should feel embarrassed!  The UK has the ability and economic power to stage a multi-billion pound Olympic Games but suddenly appears unable to house a few thousand men women and children fleeing probable death in a war zone.     Of course this is all about politics - it is a political phobia connected to immigration and the UKIP voters. There can't be another explanation why one of the richest Countries in the world can't accept more than a handful of families from Syria.     This is about political will. If we wanted to we could house many more genuine refugees in such a way that they don't overburden local resources in already overstretched areas.     Mr Cameron cannot hide behind words uttered by him and others about 'swarming refugees' or even crueller words by fame hungry individuals talking about 'cockroaches'.     Most of the todays papers have featured to shocking photograph of three year old Aylan Kurdi - found drowned on a beach in Turkey. The crisis has been given a name and it is to the credit of most of the UK newspapers that they have covered that story.    Leading Conservatives are calling for the Prime Minister to accept more refugees. Others argue that taking in refugees will not address the main problem - but there are no obvious plans to address the main problem - that Syria is a dreadful war zone.     Perhaps the photograph of this innocent victim of the war in Syria will prove a turning point in public sentiment in the UK and the Prime Minister may find himself being seen not as a Leader on this important issue but as someone who has no answers or someone ignoring the will of the people.    Sometimes words are not enough and Countries will be judged like people - it is often what you do that counts - not what you say.

These are my 10 not-to-be missed happenings in the art world in London, through to the end of the year. Consider your diary sorted.      1. The Frank Auerbach exhibition at Tate Britain. Curated by Catherine Lampert, who has sat weekly for Auerbach for the past 37 years, and with Auerbach's own input at Tate, this is bound to be a unique and moving retrospective of a life's work. London-based American artist Doug Fishbone, an admirer of the ruggedness and density of Auerbach's works, is "looking forward to the privilege of seeing such a range of Auerbach's paintings under one roof".      Auerbach - Tate : Frank Auerbach, Head of J.Y.M ll 1984-85  Painting, Oil on canvas, 660 x 610 mm  Private collection  © Frank Auerbach      2. Goya, Giacometti and the Portrait. In an era when the entire world is obsessed with the portraiture in the form of "selfies", two spectacular exhibitions focusing on portraiture are soon to be on view. Goya is often considered one of the most psychologically revealing painters and the exhibition opening at the National Gallery (October 7th) is expected to be one of the highlights of the autumn. Lesser-known for his portraits, but still the highest selling sculptor of all time, Alberto Giacometti's lifelong love of portraiture will be revealed next door at the National Gallery on October 15th.        Francisco de Goya, The Marchioness of Santa Cruz, 1805, Oil on canvas, 124.7 × 207.7 cm  Museo Nacional del Prado. Madrid  P07070  © Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado      3. Ai Weiwei at the RA. We asked art advisor Viola Raikhel-Bolot of 1858 Art Advisory for her highlight of the autumn season - and it was an immediate nod towards Ai Weiwei at the RA. Raikhel-Bolot says "These will be exceptional works in a deserved setting; there's a poetry behind his work, which is always truly mesmerizing"        Royal Academy, Ai Weiwei Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, 1995, courtesy Ai Weiwei      4.      Frieze/Frieze Masters/PAD. It's impossible to escape the maelstrom during Frieze week, but we confess that it's addictive, exhausting, exhilarating and un-missable. All eyes will be on Sir Norman Rosenthal, who is curating a brand-new section of Frieze called Collections.  Let's also not forget PAD in Berkeley Square, which continues to surprise and delight and is a firm favourite of Georgina Hepburne Scott, head of Art Management at Stonehage Fleming.        Boris Mikhailov, Yesterday's Sandwich (plate 46), c.1966-1968, C-type print from dia, 90×130cm. Courtesy of Sprovieri.     5. Galleries big and small throughout London in October. Marian Goodman is following up her astounding Richter show during last year's Frieze with the first show in London for 15 years dedicated to the legendary William Kentridge, while David Zwirner is backing the art-world darling Oscar Murillo. Lisson Gallery's Ryan Gander is bound to provoke controversy but our very top choice would be Blain Southern's partnership with the achingly hip Vinyl Factory, presenting rarely-seen works from Bill Viola's early career. Exhibited at Hanover Square and Brewer St car park, these complimentary exhibitions involving sound, refracted light and bodies of water should not be missed. Additional personal favourites also include Gordon Cheung at Edel Assanti as well as the legendary Judy Chicago at Riflemaker.         Bill Viola in Mt Rainier coffee shop July 1979, Photo Kira Perov, Courtesy of the artist and BlainSouthern    6. The Line: a wonderfully ambitious project now comes to fruition. Following the success of the 2012 Olympics in East London, Megan Piper has worked wonders in creating an innovative sculpture walk along the site's waterways, with artists such as Martin Creed, Eduardo Paolozzi and Antony Gormley. Plan to spend a good couple of hours "walking the line".         Thomson & Craighead, HERE, 2013  Custom Signpost, 264 × 82 × 12CM, On loan courtesy of the artists and Carroll/Fletcher    7. Sluice Art Fair. We admit we're slightly biased here, as one of London Art Studies' lecturers, Ben Street is co-director, but this smaller, bi-annual satellite fair during Frieze week "offers an alternative view of contemporary art today, focusing on grassroots art scenes, led by artists rather than dealers," according to Ben.         Sluice - Image courtesy of Sluice.    8. Christie's "Multiplied" Sale. Held during Frieze week this is a great starting point for beginning an art collection.  It's the only fair in the UK completely dedicated to "multiple" works of art. Expect to see prints from luminaries of the art world, as well as exciting emerging talent.

When will it officially open? We've heard that the space is simply astonishing and are intrigued that John Hoyland is the subject for its first exhibition. We're also curious to see Gagosian's new space in Mayfair (launching 8th October) with a solo exhibition by Cy Twombly. It will be the 15th gallery for the dealer, who has a presence in seven countries, and the space will apparently span an extraordinary 18,000 square foot.        Gagosian - Image courtesy of Gagosian Gallery.    10. "The Walk" - for those of you determined to stay comfortably at home, we would recommend this movie. Robert Zemeckis re-tells the amazing story of high-wire artist Philippe Petit's walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Already filmed as a documentary in "Man on Wire", "The Walk" will star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the French artist, and is scheduled to open October 9th worldwide. We suspect Zemeckis will bring an edge-of-seat Hollywood experience to the film - think "Mission Impossible" of the art world.

Kate Gordon  London Art Studies    About our author  London Art Studies Founder Kate Gordon was Head of Public Programmes at Sotheby's Institute of Art and CNN Global Arts Producer. Kate's inspiration for setting up London Art Studies in 2012 was the huge increase of interest in the arts over the last 10 years and the desire to make education exciting. Her approach is to put together compelling, richly anecdotal, on-trend lecture content within a sophisticated, convivial environment.    This year London Art Studies launched an exclusive partnership with the Bulgari Hotel in London's Knightsbridge where students can learn about collecting, explore current exhibitions and witness lively debate focussed around themes in the art world. Subjects this autumn include "The Insider's Guide to Frieze", "Legacy: The Collecting Series" as well as "The Story of Haute Couture".

Unlike the "alien woman" some UFO hunters got excited about last month, this "spoon" physically exists on the red planet.    According to NASA, it is called a ventifact -- a rock shaped by wind.     Ok, so it's not excess cutlery left over by a martian but it's still an interesting geological feature.     There is no spoon. This weird Mars feature is likely a ventifact—a rock shaped by wind. Info: http://t.co/pF9UOlj7ct pic.twitter.com/p1CSNGCDuJ— Curiosity Rover (@MarsCuriosity) September 2, 2015      In a statement, NASA explained rocks can be gradually sculpted as dust and sand impact its surface over time.     Wind-blasted surfaces can often expose the texture and colour of a rock.    So, the shiny metallic object seen in the image below is actually a rock that has a fine grain and is relatively hard.         According to NASA, these types of rocks can be "polished by the wind to form smooth surfaces"    Ventifacts are not exclusive to Mars, it is also found in Antarctica.    We're just relieved the 'spoon' is not another case of Pareidolia -- a term that describes our need to explain something not as it logically should be, but rather by what we'd like it to be.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 10:40:45	‘EastEnders' Barmaid Tracey FINALLY Has A Storyline: Here's What Should Happen Next...	‘EastEnders’ barmaid Tracey has been (literally) lurking in the soap’s background scenes for 30 years, but now, she’s finally about to play a huge role in one of the biggest plots since, well, ever.     Kathy Beale’s much-hyped return has been playing out for months, and in the coming weeks, viewers will see Gillian Taylforth’s character finally make her presence known to the whole Square. This is where Tracey comes in.       Jane Slaughter has played Tracey for 30 years    The usually silent barmaid will get a blast from the past when she answers the phone at The Vic, and hears her ol’ pal Kathy’s voice, which is obviously a shock given that Kathy ‘died’ in 2006.     Tracey, unaware that Phil has been helping his ex, then reveals the news to Mick Carter, who then has to deal with the double shock of learning that Tracey actually has a voice box, and Ian Beale’s mum is still alive.     We reckon this should be just the beginning for Trace, and just in case the ‘EastEnders’ team need a hand, we’ve come up with some potential storylines for actress Jane to get her teeth into…     1. Con the Carters and take her rightful place as the Queen Vic’s Landlady    We love Linda and Mick as much as the next person, but let’s be honest, the pub couldn’t function without Tracey. She’s served more pints and ploughman's than the whole Carter family put together and perhaps having her name above the door would make Tracey come out of her shell.     2. Bedding Phil Mitchell         Tracey and Phil have known each other for years, and helping Kathy could finally make them realise their feelings for each other. Obviously, there would be serious ramifications…     3. A HUGE Cat Fight With Sharon      Sharon would not take too kindly to Tracey stealing her man, which would give the barmaid a chance to join the ‘EastEnders’ catfight hall of fame. She’s witnessed more than a few bar brawls in her time, but could Tracey take on Sharon? We’re not so sure.     4. Team up with Kim for a night out in the West End         Another ‘EastEnders’ rite of passage is a “big night out West”. It takes a special occasion for the ladies of E20 to pile into a cab and make their way to Leicester Square for a Woo Woos, but if Tracey breaking her silence isn’t cause for a big night out, then we don’t know what is.     5.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 11:17:04	Boy Meets Girl: The Versatile Actress Rebecca Root Stars in Groundbreaking Comedy	The first thing I notice when I meet Rebecca Root is her smile. Warm, open and friendly, it lights up the room. We meet at Fringe Central 1, in Edinburgh, where she is at the end of her run playing Eden in the award-winning show Trans Scripts. It is not the lightest of topics for a fringe show, but the verbatim piece about the life experiences of transgender women, are the key ingredients to one of the most educational and thought provoking shows at this year's festival.    Her character Eden is very complex and quite aggressive whereas Root is engaged and open. It's as draining a part as anything she's ever done but exhilarating too, in front of a live audience for a month with her fellow actresses, baring their souls day in day out. She says: "The first couple of weeks of the run I had to find a way to negotiate the path in and out of Eden, so to speak, so my prep and my getting out of character has become less stressful as the time has gone on."    Eden is both tough and independent but damaged and vulnerable. Having witnessed the performance of Trans Scripts and watched the screening for BBC2's new comedy Boy Meets Girl, where Root plays the loveable Judy, her versatility as an actress is astonishing. "I'm pleased that you've seen both sides of Rebecca Root because I think few people will get to see that," she adds.    Sitting next to Root, on the low sofa, we chat at length about her groundbreaking role in the first mainstream UK sitcom to cast a transgender actor in a leading transgender role, and her hopes for the show. So what is her part and why does she love it so much? "Judy is adorable, funny, warm, she's a bit inept at times but she's just charming, I'm not saying she's without her complexities but her heart is in the right place."    Judy is a transgender woman in her 40's who meets a younger man, Leo (played by Harry Hepple), in a bar and they hit it off. The couple are on their first date at a restaurant when Judy utters the words: "I was born with a penis." Written by Trans Comedy Award script writer, Elliott Kerrigan, Boy Meets Girl is simply a love story. The fact that Judy is transgender is only one element in a funny and touching romance.    Unlike her character, Root shies away from dating, for self-preservation "who puts themselves in the line of fire of heartbreak." But that's not to say she wouldn't like to. "One day perhaps I will meet someone."    Root grew up in a middle-class, loving family in Surrey. Her parents and two sisters supported her in her desire to act but she found there was no one she could really talk to about how she was feeling at the time. Acting in school plays gave her a way to be female, if only for a short time. "Suddenly I had this creative outlet, I had something that I loved, and something that I could aspire to."    It is clear to see the passion that Root shows for her work, "I care so much I can't tell you, I am so passionate about my craft! I take my craft and my profession very seriously and I do classes and read books and talk to a lot of actors and I watch their performances. I scrutinise what they do and wonder how they do it, I'm like a child again."    Her transition began in 2000 and she recalls that probably the hardest part was making the decision to do it, "I knew what I had to do but I wasn't sure how I could do it. It took me a long time of conversations with doctors and specialists."     She would advise any young person who is struggling with their identity today "to be brave, breathe deep, look at yourself in the mirror and smile, I taught myself to look in the mirror and smile once a day and that way I am guaranteed one smile. But that smile buffers me against all the frowns, glances and the 'what the...' that I still even now occasionally get."    Articulate and informed it is hard to imagine a better ambassador than Root for the transgender community. Does she feel a sense of responsibility in this role ? "In life if you're given an opportunity to share a perspective on life, or society or humanity, it would be churlish not to accept that role, and to try and do good with that    "I do workshops now with youth transgender groups, the NHS and I'm a mentor for young people. I don't necessarily promote myself but if anyone can benefit from it then I will do it."    Rebecca Root will also play a small part in the hugely anticipated The Danish Girl, an autobiographical drama based on one of the first known recipients of sexual reassignment surgery, Lili Elbe, played by Eddie Redmayne.    She is looking forward to the premiere of Boy Meets Girl this week but feels that "it's funny because I'm in a bit of a bubble at the moment, although it is very exciting I'm realistic in that I'll believe it when I see it. I hope the audience like it.    "This is not just my moment, it's Elliott's moment, it's the rest of the superb cast's moment. It is very much an ensemble. But it's also the trans community's moment. I have been contacted on social media by a lot of trans women saying 'I have seen the trailer , it looks great, fingers crossed, thanks for all you are doing'. That means a lot."    With a supporting cast that includes Denise Welch, Lizzie Roper and Nigel Betts, this may just simply be a funny tale of boy meets girl. 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	A.J.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 11:20:54	Iron Maiden Singer Bruce Dickinson Says His Tongue Cancer Was Caused By Too Much Oral Sex	Iron Maiden’s lead singer Bruce Dickinson has said he believes his tongue cancer was caused by too much oral sex.    The rocker, who was given the all-clear from the disease earlier this year after weeks of chemotherapy, says it could have been the result of a sexually transmitted HPV (human papillomavirus).    The virus is passed on through oral sex with women, and now the 56-year-old is hoping to raise more awareness of the link between the two diseases.      Bruce Dickinson    In an interview with Jim Norton on Opie Radio, he said: "The thing about the HPV virus is people don't know a great deal about it. I don't mean to be flippant or anything, but you would expect lesbians to have a higher incidence of it.    "But no, there's is 25 percent less than in men. It seems to be something that affects men. There are 150 or so strains of HPV virus, but only a couple you're interested in, 80 percent of us have been exposed to it, and you can't get rid of it.    "It comes and it goes. For some reason, and nobody knows why, in guys over 40 it can persist. The virus leaves behind a little genetic code, that starts off the cancer."    It’s not the first time a star has spoken of the link between oral cancer and oral sex.    Michael Douglas, who also overcame tongue cancer, has previously said that that his illness could have been caused by the HPV virus transmitted by oral sex.    He told the Guardian: "Without wanting to get too specific this particular cancer is caused by HPV."    Douglas said: "I did worry if the stress caused by my son's incarceration didn't help trigger it.    "But yeah, it's a sexually transmitted disease that causes cancer."

The Resolution Foundation think tank raises questions over the central tenet of the Chancellor's Summer Budget, where he argued a new minimum wage for over-25s would mean a "typical" working family is "better off”.    Mr Osborne argued cuts to benefits, including tax credits offered to low-paid workers, should be seen as part of a package alongside a national living wage (NLW) pegged at £7.20 an hour from April and rising to £9.35 by 2020.    But the Resolution Foundation says the move will only "partially" softens the impact of the cuts to the poorest households. The SNP said the Chancellor had pulled a "con trick".    It has produced a graph - using official data - to argue the half of the country's households on the lowest incomes will only see their loss reduced by 13%. The very poorest households wills still lose more than £800 a year, or more than 8% in total.        Resolution says only around a quarter of households gaining from the NLW will see the pay boost outstrip the loss suffered by a cut to benefits.    It points out the NLW was expected to increase the country's wage bill by £4.5 billion in 2020, and only around 60 per cent of that would be felt in workers' pockets, which falls short of mitigating the £13 billion cuts to welfare.    Report author Conor D’Arcy said: “The new National Living Wage will give a welcome boost to the wages of millions of low-paid workers.    "But it’s no substitute for the vital support that households receive through tax credits and other in-work benefits.     "Indeed, many low-income families will find that the welcome extra pay they receive will be dwarfed by reductions to in-work support, which could leave them thousands of pounds worse off.     “The National Living Wage is a game changer in terms of tackling low pay, but it can’t solve Britain’s living standards challenge.”    Conor D'Arcy: The National Living Wage Is a Bold Step Forward on Low Pay - But It Won't Make the Living Standards Challenge Disappear    SEE ALSO:    National Living Wage Announced By George Osborne...But Only For 25s And Over    Budget Sees George Osborne Freeze Public Sector Pay Rises At 1% For Four Years    SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said: “This report again confirms that the Tories new National Living Wage is nothing more than a con-trick – designed to mask massive cuts to social security.    "We already know that under 18s will now be entitled to thousands less than colleagues doing the same job. Now we know that less than half the gains from this enhanced Minimum Wage rate will go to the bottom half of the income distribution.     “While we welcome the increase in the Minimum Wage for over 25s, this report finds that it will do little to offset the impact of the budget – particularly for the poorest households. Shamefully, by 2020 those in the poorest households will be more than £800 worse off every single year due to the Tories heartless budget cuts."    The report found women would stand to benefit most, with more than three and a half million women set to receive a pay rise as a result of the NLW. Since women tend to be in low-wage jobs, they will receive 61% of the benefits.    The estimate includes both women who currently earn less than the minimum and those whose income is likely to be lifted by a “ripple effect” further up the pay scale, and will slightly narrow the gender pay gap.    Mr Osborne said: "In the Budget I announced a new settlement for the British people, one that will create a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare economy backed by a new National Living Wage.    "And today's report by the Resolution Foundation provides a new vote of confidence in the National Living Wage, confirming 6 million people will benefit with an average pay rise of over £1,200.    "Britain deserves a pay rise - and this government is making sure it gets one."

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 11:42:01	Review: People, Places and Things at National Theatre	      What do we look for in great theatre? What is it we see and hear in a show that makes us want to recommend it?    A story that grabs us? Acting that impresses? Is resonance important? What about risk? Theatre, for me, should always take risks. What else? Some look for innovative direction, or impressive production design; others want a soundtrack that rings in their ears even after they've left the auditorium. And above all of this, we've got to care. We've really got to care about what happens.    Well, all of these things are present in People, Places and Things, a co-production with Headlong that has just opened at the National Theatre - a stunning piece of theatre set in a drugs and alcohol rehabilitation centre that explores how on earth we can hold it together in a world that's so full of suffering and hard knocks.          Denise Gough is superb as Emma, a woman battling herself and everyone else as she tries to navigate a path through rehab and out the other side. Emma is in a bad way - her addictions are so profound that they are sabotaging her career, and they've already ruined her relationship with her family.    Only Emma has no intention of letting down her guard, of admitting that she is in desperate need of help. Instead she is determined that the walls she has built around her will stay up and that she'll push through rehab on her terms alone.    Of course that's not going to happen. But Emma is not an entirely sympathetic character. She's narcissistic and spiteful, wilfully lashing out at all who try to help her, especially her assigned Doctor (a perfectly pitched counterweight performance from Barbara Marten who is as calm as Emma is angry).          This is a world of addictions, trauma and tears. But this is too smart a play to be working just on that level. This is a play about identity, about our place in the world and our struggles to come to terms with the sheer scale of our mortality, and questions the point of a life of sobriety when even our existence has so little purpose.    And at the heart of this world is a truly extraordinary piece of acting from Denise Gough. My god, her Emma is unlikeable but my god, you feel for her. By the end you are completely on her side. That she gets you to care so much for someone who is so selfish is a testament to the vulnerability Denise brings to the role.    She is, of course, enabled by some terrific writing from Duncan Macmillan who has created such a complex and complicated woman. But there is also real bravery in his commitment to long, extended scenes. Such is the preference now for short, sharp scenes that it's quite a jolt to sit through 20 minute scenes of just Emma arguing with either her doctor or a fellow patient on her commitment to the program, or whether she is being entirely truthful with her back-story.    But it's a jolt I like. And it works because both the acting and the dialogue are interesting. It might not always be on the edge of your seat stuff but I like that. This is therapy. This is ever decreasing circles we're exploring here. This is the 'slow, slow, quick, quick, slow' dismantling of all the walls we build up around us. I was completely engrossed.          The direction comes from Headlong's Artistic Director, Jeremy Herrin, and it is both clever and bold. The long group therapy scenes and confessional sessions are shot through with injections of vivid, electric hallucinatory spirals where multiple doppelgängers take to the stage to play out the visions in Emma's head. (But are they hallucinations? Maybe they're real - fragments of Emma's experiences. The walls between reality and imagination are very porous in this production).    And this is complemented with some smart production design from Bunny Christie and Andrzej Goulding, which sees tiles from the walls breaking up, evaporating up into the air - representing not just the effect of the drugs but the flimsiness of all the metaphorical walls on display.    If I was being really picky, I would have lopped off the last five minutes. The penultimate scene is a punch to the stomach. It's awesome. Such is the visceral power of this scene I wish it would have ended there, with the horror that the people, places and things that trigger us in our lives, that cause us to panic and quake in fear, are the very people, places and things we haven't got a hope in hell of avoiding.    But this is a small gripe in what is a stunning and emotional production that hits both the heart and the head.

Certificate 15  Rating: ****  Writer-director Anna Muylaert's 'The Second Mother' is punchy, smart and subtle with a sharp script and Regina Case gives a performance that's timed to comic perfection - she's a gem.    Val (Regina Case) left her daughter Jessica (Camila Mardila) with relatives a decade ago to be a live-in maid and nanny to Dona Barbara (Karine Teles), her doting husband Dr Carlos (Laurenco Mutarelli) and their son Fabinho (Michel Joelsas) in Sao Paulo. She's part of the family, a fixture they depend upon but there's a dividing line between servant and the family and Val abides by the house rules.  It's a wow out-of-the-blue surprise when Jessica calls and says that she's coming to Sao Paulo to take her college entrance exams. Val's thrilled, her employer's supportive, it's a dream come true. Just one slight problem - Jessica doesn't follow her mother's servant-employer house rules. To her it's a challenge and soon the family are affected by Jessica's personality and candor and Val's in a tug-of-war. It's a choice between her daughter and her employer and her surrogate son, Fabinho.     Sharp, bright and witty with a tight structured script, terrific performances and Regina Case's dream comic timing's a winner. it's a delight.

Well sit back, relax and enjoy because 'Me And Earl And The Dying Girl', a coming-of-age indie with a laid back feel is original, innovative, funny and insightful with a spot on script by Jesse Andrews and a cast who slip into their roles with ease.    Greg's (Thomas Mann) not into emotional involvement. In fact he's so on the edge that he refers to his best pal Earl (RJ Cyler) as his co-worker. They're movie buffs and make short film parodies in video stop-motion animation with crazy titles like Blue Vervet (Blue Velvet) and Sockwork Orange (Clockwork Orange). Of course the parents are nutty but Greg didn't expect to be ordered by his mother (Connnie Britton) to visit Rachael (Olivia Cooke) who's in his class but he doesn't know and has been diagnosed with leukaemia. Breath deeply Greg because you've got to get past Rachael's mother Denise (Molly Shannon) who's got the hots for him.     Will it work with Rachael and will she like his movies? Will Greg, the movie buff start thinking of others other than himself?    Appealing, original, a mixture of tears and laughter and a lot of charm.    Released 4th September        Director: Remy Bennett, Emilie Frooza  Cast: Remy Bennett, Pauly Lingerfelt, Evan Louison  Genre: Drama, Romance  Language: English  Country of Origin: USA   2015   96 mins.  Certificate 18  Rating: **  There's something of the revisit old territory about this directorial debut that plods the well trodden cliches of psychosexual jealousy and a secret from the past framed in the sweat dripping Louisiana heat.     Pernilla (Remy Bennett), obsessive, child-like and lonely and Patrick (Evan Louison) have a past that haunts them. When a childhood playmate commits suicide, Pernilla ups and leaves New York's seedy underbelly and knocks on Patrick's cabin door in an unnamed Louisiana town. Lines are blurred and playful games merge into sexual jealousy and cruelty as the obsessed couple become lost in their fantasies and their relationship takes a darker side.    A deep south wooden cabin, off-the-wall tattooed characters that have hitched a ride from the sidelines and a psychedelic visual style is no substitute for weak narrative and a disjointed glance at Pernilla and Patrick who are best left deep south. It tries to hitch a ride on David Lynch and Tennessee Williams but doesn't quite get there and drops very, very slowly into the pretentious bin.     Released 4th september         Director: Liv Ullmann  Cast: Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, Samantha Moron  Genre: Drama  Language: English  Country of Origin: Norway, UK   2014   129 mins.  Certificate 15  Rating: ****  Utterly mesmerising, emotionally brutal theatre. August Strindberg's 1888 'Miss Julie,' a play that's entirely conversation is handed by Liv Ullman to three actors who fill the screen with raw emotion.     It's a stand off between servant and aristocrat, raw and brutal. The manipulative game begins. John (Colin Farrell), valet to the Baron, who's late 19th Century Ango-Irish aristocracy in the North of Ireland is engaged to the maid Cathleen (Samantha Morton). The Baron's daughter Julie (Jessica Chastain) requests a dance but she wants more including for John to kiss her boot in apology for talking about her to Cathleen. Miss Julie flaunts her sex and John reveals his repressed feeling for her which draws them into a duel between aristocrat and the servant trapped in his social station whose lust turns to contempt for the 'fallen woman.' In this battle for power and dominance, many of the monologues are delivered in one take, Mikhail Krichman's camera capturing the raw emotional power of the stunning performances, figures trapped by the madness, wounded and betrayed. And all Cathleen can do is to observe the descent into madness.    My rating reflects the brilliant theatre and masterful performances but as cinema I'd hoped for greater visual freedom outside of the castle. Whatever said, it's stunning and powerful.    Released 4th September          Director: Jafar Panahi, Kambuzia Partovi  Cast: Maryam Mogadam, Jafar Panahi  Genre: Drama  Language: Persian with English subtitles  Country of Origin: Iran   2013  106  mins.  Winner Silver Bear Best Screenplay 2013 Berlin Film Festival  Certificate 12A  Rating: ***    A non-film, made in secret by Jafar Panahir, a film maker trapped within his own thoughts.    'Closed Curtain' opens with a stunning long shot. Through barred windows we watch two figures cross towards the house. The driver returns to his car. A man (Kambuzia Partovi) enters the house with a suitcase and bottles of water, unzips the suitcase and a dog jumps out. Dogs are 'impure' in Islamic society. The man pulls the curtains and hangs covers over the windows. The man shaves his head. A mysterious woman (Maryan Moqadam) and her brother (Hadi Saeedi) come in. There are voices outside. Are they the police? Jafar Panahi appears as himself acting out his fantasies. Strangers and neighbours come and go. Reality and fantasy blend in a surreal and tense world.    Jafar Panahi can't leave Iran and is forbidden from making films for 20 years. A man trapped in his own thoughts. His house, a prison. Challenging and innovative. A film very much for the art house circuit.    Released 4th September    Other Releases this week    Cartel Land (15) 98 mins. Documentary.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 11:54:48	Five Symptoms of Edinburgh Festival Participant Leftover Bodily Function Syndrome	    An eerie, empty Royal Mile    The Festival has ended but you can't quite seem to get it out of your system. Here are five common symptoms to watch out for when suffering from Edinburgh Festival Participant Leftover Bodily Functions Syndrome. This needs nipping in the bud fast. Here's why:    1) Flyering is in your veins:    It starts at the airport on your way home. You mistake the security queue for the Half Price Hut and get going on your sales pitch to a group of unwitting Norwegians. 'Hi guys! Looking for some comedy today?!' You pipe up over enthusiastically in your best 'I'm fun' voice. Then fling your clear plastic bag of under 100ml liquids at them and realise in the same instant that you are not carrying a pile of your face around anymore. The leaflet holding shaped claws that were once hands just need a bit of time to readjust. Apologise and swing your way deftly to the next available box office cashier - I mean airport security staff.     2) You've forgotten that non-beige food exists:     Your diet has consisted of nothing but portions of chips coated in various shades of a jam like substance claiming to be ketchup and the odd cheeky Nandos. With extra chips.   You deluded yourself into thinking that 'mixing it up' with a curry from Udderbelly one night and a banana and Nutella crepe at Gilded Balloon the next was giving you nutritional variety. 'Perhaps vegetables are actually mythical things?'; 'Perhaps they were never a real part of my life?..' You despaired as you stared into the middle distance at a Frankfurter van on the corner of Potterow. Fear not. You're home now and a Sainsburys delivery is just a few clicks away. Go for leaves. And lots of them.       3) You have spent the month running to shows. You can't seem to stop:     You were ambitious. You bit off more than you could chew. It was your day off after all. You went in strong and booked an 11am piece of physical theatre at C venues followed by four consecutive hours of comics in various Free Fringe haunts then a circus extravaganza at The Hub. You even topped it off with a late night Improvised Musical Opera based on the life of Nietzsche and his contemporaries who all happened to be witches trapped in a Bake Off Final.     Contrary to popular belief it did not take seven minutes to get from the Royal Mile to Pleasance Courtyard. There were crowds to contend with. The whole thing was bloody exhausting and you only just made it to each show. Now you're back in London you find yourself expertly dodging through the crowds at Bank Station during rush hour screaming things like 'they don't allow latecomers let me through!!!' Or 'The show must go on!!' You are a moron. Let the Festival go.     4) Seeing stars:     Your eyes are having trouble re-adjusting. They have been subjected to a month of looking at row upon row of stars on people's faces. Everywhere. You see your other half on arrival at King's Cross and as you hug each other the review involuntarily leaps from your mouth: 'FIVE STARS!!! An excellent hug. Fantastically executed and engaging from start to finish!!' Oh god. What's the matter with you? You are not Broadway Baby. You are a human person. Stop rating stuff.     5) Time looses all meaning:     You just can't shake the festival vibe. Your mate's show finished at 11.30pm. That's like 7pm in Edinburgh time right? You had drinks at The Abbattoir every night (fancy pants) and you relived your youth with the other 12-year-olds ripping up the sticky dance floor at The Hive. It was AHHsome with a capital AHH.     You now find yourself walking the streets near home at various ungodly hours in search of fun. You can't understand why no one else is out at 4am making an ill advised trip to CC Blooms for another hour of sweat fest dancing.     'There must be some awards thing happening?!' You cry - 'I shall find it!' and climbing to the top of the stairs in your own house in search of the Loft Bar it slowly dawns on you that it's over. The So You Think You're Funny free booze is gone for another year. Make a cuppa babe. You'll be alright. Your body could probably do with the break anyway to be honest.     Whatever you do don't panic. This is not permanent. You will recover.     Have a read of something other than the fringe guide. It's crispy from the afternoon it pissed it down and it's gone a weird shape now anyway. Pick up a real book, or even better the phone and talk to a mate you neglected for a month because you found loads of new 'ultra festival bezzies guys!'. Get back to normal slowly but surely. It'll be January in a minute and you'll have to get your 2016 application in....        An ACTUAL audience member ACTUALLY gave me these mental shades because they matched my shirt. Love. the. Festival.    Helen Sorren is an actress and comedian. She co hosts the Saturday Breakfast Show on Hoxton Radio and has appeared in numerous stage productions.

While I am generally not a fan of them, open letters are clearly mandatory in the blogging world and I don't want to be known as 'that blogger' with her head so far up her arse, she never took the time to dish out unsolicited advice and opinion to someone she doesn't actually know. So I have written six mini open 'mummy' letters to some celebrities, in a bid to secure some credibility...      Dear Kate Middleton,    I think you have lovely hair and a dead genuine smile and everything, but with loads of respect, I don't really care that you are now a mum of two. So, while many-a blogger might like to drop you a line about how to cope with a couple of kids, I'm not sure I can sincerely do that when our lives are so ridiculously different. You have been trained to drink tea according to royal etiquette; I slurp it (cold) from a Dolly Parton mug. You have to sit in a certain manner; I don't really sit down much. You curtsy; I cuss. Do you get my drift? So my advice for you is to write an open letter yourself and thank everyone for their kind concern, but explain that unlike, say, a single mum living in a bedsit without much cash or family to lean on, you're not too badly off, and therefore, grateful as you are, you'll probably ignore the many missives from people you have never met.  In fact, feel free to blank me too, yeah?     Take care now,    Zeena      Dear Mummy Pig,    I am in awe of your incredibly upbeat style of parenting. When my toddler jumps up and down in muddy puddles (thanks for that by the way), I must confess I rarely say: "Never mind, it's only mud." I'm afraid I tend to swear under my breath and wonder where I'm going to get a clean outfit from given everything else is in the bastard laundry bag. And when my other half loses his glasses, I never chuckle and call him 'silly' - I call him a knob. I think, Mummy Pig, you need to let rip a bit. Give Suzy Sheep's mum a ring and see if she fancies a night out? Get bladdered, stagger home at 2am singing the Bing Bong Song and stay in bed until noon the next day. Daddy Pig can bring you a bacon sandwich in the morning... Oh, sorry...    Look after yourself,    Zeena      Dear Gwyneth Paltrow,    I owe you an apology. It's true I have found your earth mother views quite irritating. I felt judged by you, as I'm the sort of mum who lets her kids watch back-to-back Ben and Holly, while you prefer yours to watch cartoons in French and Spanish. But I realise scoffing at you for being an affected bore who psychobabbles about "conscious uncoupling" and "co-parenting", was also, perhaps, a tad judgey too. So now you have my (obviously life-changing) apology, here are my sage words for you: Maybe dilute some of the pretentious parenting advice on your site Goop with realistic stuff for the rest of us plebs? For instance, Swiss Chard Spanakopita Pie as a lunchbox idea is really, really not happening in our house, so why not list the oven-ready range of cheesy bites at Asda as an alternative? Or I can give you my recipe for Dairylea on toast..?    Speak soon,    Zeena      Dear Holly Willoughby    I love you. Don't be scared or anything but I really feel like if we met, we'd definitely be mum friends. I'll admit I'm not exactly the sunny girl-next-door type like yourself (I'm more the haggard hag across the road), but I admire the elementary manner with which you talk about motherhood. You're like the antithesis of the soul-searchy shit spouted everywhere in the celeb world. Stay sweet dearest Holly, and give me a call some time? Maybe we could take our kids to soft play together or I could drink wine in your kitchen? You know, whatever...    Love you,    Zeena      Dear Tamara Ecclestone,    If I had taken a 'brelfie' while breastfeeding my children it most certainly wouldn't have looked anything like your now infamous poolside shot. Mine would depict a hunched woman in a tea-stained dressing gown slumped on the couch in front of Homes Under the Hammer - imagine a zoned-out Meatloaf with knackered jugs. It wasn't pretty. Knackered jugs aside, all the hoo-hah since you tweeted that photograph is a complete mystery to me. A breast, bottle, one of those weird yogurt drink tubes - it's all just a means of sustenance for a child and doesn't have to be perceived as some sort of political statement. So my suggestion for you is to take a load more breastfeeding photos while your tits still look that good.    Good luck to you,    Zeena      Dear Fellow Mum Who's Not on the Telly,    "But I am not famous!" I hear you cry. Oh, but you are the biggest star of all, Fellow Mum. (Stop spewing. This is good shit - mummy bloggers practically break the internet with stuff like this). My counsel for you? Don't take any advice. You're doing fine.  I know you're far too smart for the sort of motherhood-makes-us-sisters guff you get on those nauseating e-cards, so I'll put it in terms that I believe suit us both; you're an excellent mum - more wine?    Laters!    Zeena    Gizza needy like here please..? https://www.facebook.com/wordtothemothers    You can read the original post here: https://zeenamoolla.wordpress.com/ 	UK Entertainment - The Huffington Post	Zeena Moolla	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/zeena-moolla/six-open-mummy-letters_b_8076530.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:03:47	Is the Future of the Labour Party in Tim Farron's Hands?	If Jeremy Corbyn is successful in his Labour leadership bid, despite Chuka Umunna's call for unity around a new leader, there will be calls for a breakaway. The way the other leadership candidates and Labour insiders are talking, it's as if a Corbyn victory will spell Armageddon for Labour - as Dan Hodges wrote just this week. Whether it's bluster or the real McCoy it's worth considering the options for potential Labour defectors. The recent electoral near annihilation of the Lib Dems should make wobbling Labour members think long and hard about the merits of tearing up their membership cards. And if they are looking to jump ship there is a question mark over whether the Lib Dems under Tim Farron offer defectors an appealing and distinctive enough alternative political home. While it has become a common refrain that two-party politics is at an end, begging the question why not form another breakaway movement in this age of multi-party politics, if Labour supporters are looking to put their social democratic principles into practise then the SDP's warning from history might make them think twice.     The Lib Dems were of course formed by the marriage of one of the oldest and one of the newest political movements in Britain in 1988 following the failure of both to achieve electoral success in the 1987 general election. However, some partners were more equal than others - recall Spitting Image's bruising satire on their uneasy alliance: 'from our side we'll take 'Social Democratic', and from your side, we'll take 'Party''. The SDP had broken away from the Labour Party in 1981 when the 'Gang of Four', Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, concerned with the lurch to the left of Labour under Michael Foot, broke away and formed their own left-centerist party. Labour under a Corbyn leadership would almost certainly suffer a similar lurch to the left. The question is, what options do those disenfranchised centerist Labour-ites have if they cannot stomach the newly Old Labour, and crucially do the Lib Dems offer defectors an attractive alternative?    Potential defectors broadly have three choices: grin and bear it and hope that Corbyn falls before too much damage is done, form a new SDP (preferably with a catchier name), or join the old SDP - the eviscerated Lib Dems under new leader, Tim Farron. Most will take the first option - either putting up with Corbyn, supporting him or waiting for the all-but-inevitable second leadership election in this parliament. The second option just seems unlikely - the devastation of Lib Dems sends a strong warning, and it's questionable whether a new political movement can really grow out of Labour - UKIP and SNP were single issue (or close to) parties that grew from grassroots dissatisfaction with the mainstream into fully fledged parties with wide appeal. It's the third choice - defection to the Lib Dems - that presents the most plausible and interesting option.     Yet, it also begs a fundamental question: if you are, for example, a disenfranchised Labour councillor would you move to a party led by Tim Farron, a distinctly left of centre leader with interventionist instincts who will probably take the party 'back' to the kind of political territory inhabited by Charles Kennedy? I can't see New Labourites seeing Farron as their White Knight.     That said, Tim Farron's plan to shift the Lib Dems back to the left is a job made that much harder if Corbyn gets the top opposition job. Is it possible that Farron might actually hold the centre-ground more than many of us have given him credit for? Will he capitalise on the potential to woo Labour members and even MPs into the Lib Dem fold? And if he does, won't he need to anchor his party to the centre / centre-left to most effectively entice the right of Labour away from the fold? The more you start to explore the permeations of this the more complex it gets, but one thing is clear: Tim Farron has the potential to position the Lib Dems as the natural home for disaffected Labour members - the question is whether and how he does this.     It may just be that the Lib Dems under Farron are not 'progressive' enough for the new Labour posse for whom a Corbyn victory is a political anathema. You might just wonder if Clegg had held on to his party's leadership whether he might have been better placed to siphon off the odd disgruntled labour defector. We'll never know.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:05:45	Choosing an Oxbridge College	As one cohort of students are celebrating (or coming to terms with) which university they'll be heading off to this autumn, another cohort are considering their Year 12 results. For this latter group, decisions loom about UCAS forms. Which universities provide what they want in terms of course, cost, location and ambience? And for those who are contemplating Oxbridge as a destination, further decisions may be needed about which college to choose. (While Cambridge and Oxford advise students not to worry too much about choosing a college, on the sound grounds that the Colleges are far more similar than they are different, most applicants do still want to select one rather than simply making an 'open' application.)     These are tricky decisions, often inevitably based on limited information. As Master of one of the bigger, more heavily applied to and most academically successful Cambridge colleges (we were placed third in this year's Tompkins Table of undergraduate academic performance), let me tell you about some of the things that I know our students were attracted by when they chose Churchill. In this way I might assist those worrying about college choice by providing some pointers about what may be important. I don't promise to be entirely unbiased!    Churchill's undergraduate population is around 460, larger than many of the colleges. In the 2014 admissions round we accepted 140 students, compared with the smallest intake for a traditional undergraduate college of 66 at Peterhouse and 210 at Trinity, the largest. We also boast the largest site, with substantial playing fields as part of the site as opposed to fields located a mile or more away, and the largest dining hall. Figures to bear in mind if you think size matters.     We are a modern college - brutalist 1960s architecture rather than Tudor wood, but delightfully large, light rooms with much-admired windowsills for sitting on and staring out of the window - which commits to providing accommodation, often en suite and almost always on the main site, for three years of an undergraduate course. At a reasonable rent (a touch below midway in overall costs, with total transparency over what the rent covers), free wifi in all rooms and no additional fixed charges for food. These are all parameters that can vary substantially between different colleges. Oh yes, and alumni from 10 years back have told me how much the food has improved in recent years - I've certainly been enjoying it.    But these are hard facts that you can get from the College prospectus and which you can easily compare with other colleges through the site How to Choose a Cambridge College. What matters more is what I termed 'ambience' above. To some extent this is best appreciated by visiting - and there are plenty of open days to enable visits to be made: the next one at Churchill is on 25 September for all subjects. As I presided over my first Matriculation Dinner last year, the first year physicist sitting next to me confided that he had felt at home as soon as he'd walked into the College. We are, as I am constantly being told and it is self-evidently true, a friendly and unstuffy college. We even provide written notes to help the nervous work out which way to pass the port at our handful of really formal meals. No need to be embarrassed about such Cambridge trivia.    And, contrary to fairly widespread assumption, we are not full of public school kids, although we obviously value those we have: around 70% of our UK admissions come from the state sector, which is significantly above the Cambridge average, something I am very proud of. I wrote previously about how our admissions policies work, to ensure not only transparency but also that we look at every applicant in the round. Nevertheless we do have a problem I want to help solve: our gender make-up is significantly out of line with the typical close to 50:50 composition of most of the colleges. I want to see more girls apply so that we can admit more of them. Possibly because of our preponderance of students in STEM subjects (by statute 70% of our students will be in these Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths subjects), the number of female applicants is persistently lower than we would like. This, despite the fact that we can proudly cite that the College was the very first in Cambridge to vote to admit women.    What happened along the road is not clear to me, but it seems to mean we are no longer seen as a college of first choice for enough of the UK's brightest young women. Would it be an inducement to say that we have a mainly female leadership team next year, with myself, the Bursar and the Senior Tutor all being women? And we have enough female Directors of Studies in Natural Sciences that they are able to make up a whole netball team to play our students ...    So, what more can I tell you that I have discovered in my first year here? Our student support is fantastic, with a College Nurse, a Counsellor and specialist study-skills Tutors to support the Tutorial team in making sure that all students thrive to the best of their ability. We have one of the lowest non-completion rates of any of the colleges and I am sure this can be directly attributed to the excellent pastoral care and individual attention students receive. If things start to unwind, perhaps because of family issues back home, or financial or health problems, there will be people there to offer support and advice.     For some the porters are the first point of contact (although for one or two that is admittedly because they've had too much to drink!), for others it will be their Tutor or their Director of Studies. People are well-equipped to deal with these sorts of issues sensitively and confidentially, only sharing information as is appropriate to ensure that the best support is provided. Hugely important for young folk away from home, perhaps for the first time for an extended period.    So, good food, good (and guaranteed) rooms, good support - what else? A bike repair-man on site several days a week is a plus; I've used him and he's excellent and quick. Good sports - our Boat Club excelled this year - good facilities for music, with a Music Centre on site; a large lecture theatre good for film screenings and plays. And a good location, particularly if you are a physical scientist. Maths, physics, computing, materials science and much of engineering are all within 10 minutes' walk or so (less by bike); admittedly the Biomedical Campus is a decent cycle ride (or a trip on the Uni bus service) away, but town-centre science and arts departments are also pretty close. The major development of North West Cambridge is all-but adjacent (and soon there'll be a new Sainsbury's there; Cambridge is woefully short of centre-of-town supermarkets) and indeed, whereas Churchill might once have seemed on the fringes of the city, Cambridge's centre of gravity is gradually moving west to encompass it.    In short, this is a fantastic place! Come and visit and be bowled over...    This post is cross posted from my personal blog.

Until the last few days I have supported Liz for Leader because I admired her courage and recognised the truth of what she said about our need to change. However I now think we are in danger of a terminal split, and need a leader who will unite the party. Please vote for Yvette to be our leader.    In May I stood as Labour's candidate against David Cameron with an admirable team from Witney Labour. We received a record swing against a Tory PM, moving up to second, and if the same swing had been replicated across the country, Labour would have won. When the BBC published that exit poll, at our after-election party, my heart sank into my boots as I remembered how 18 years of Tory rule damaged lives and held our country back in the 1980s and 1990s.    How different we felt in May 1997, when Labour set about cutting poverty, introducing union rights and minimum wage, devolving power, and investing in health and education. That year, Yvette was elected for my home town of Pontefract, where I grew up believing in Labour as the natural party of Government. She was at the heart of a Labour Government that transformed lives for the better.    Yvette is best placed to counter the Tory government. It is well known that David Cameron has a "woman problem", and his replacement is likely to be another old Etonian like Boris who will be rattled by Yvette's forensic style. She is by far the most likely candidate to stand up in PMQs, week after week, and put the Tories on the spot. Close your eyes and imagine how the other candidates might fare. Imagine them too negotiating with Putin, Merkel or Obama - how would they do? Her experience in Parliament and the country is second to none of the other candidates. She can win for Labour. Our country needs someone who will win for Britain, not just someone who has given us a focus for our frustration this summer.    Some people say we can elect a temporary leader, to set us on the true path. That path is a dead end. There are no free hits in politics. Every day counts.    But there is another reason I have decided, like Witney CLP, to back Yvette. I remember the 1980s when the Labour Party fought itself to a standstill, and allowed Margaret Thatcher to destroy much of what we hold dear. In the 1980s the hard left, including some from Militant and other fringe groups outside the Labour family, sowed mistrust and hatred throughout our party. Ordinary hard-working party members were denounced as traitors. Constituencies spent endless evenings bickering over Trotskyite dogma, while the people we aim to represent suffered and the economy was held back.    My father was a lifelong socialist. In 1979 he won the seat of Leeds for Labour in the first ever European Parliament. Meanwhile Labour infighting, extreme positions and hard left stances saw us lose Labour heartlands such as Liverpool, Birmingham, North Wales, Fife, Lothians, Bristol and most of Manchester to the Tories. In the following years, rather than being backed to oppose Conservative cuts and destruction, he was harassed and eventually deselected by hard left anti-European extremists. Thankfully, he and other mainstream Labour people such as Neil Kinnock kept the faith, and our party was reborn as a government for all, but not until after my father's death in 1995, and too much suffering and waste under Tories, and long after extremists had wandered away from Labour to protest and champion their unpleasant ways elsewhere.    I don't want to die before I next see a Labour government. Yvette is the leader who can unite our party to win. We are at our best as a broad coalition, dedicated to reducing inequality and eradicating poverty, fighting for peace and justice, and providing a stable and supportive base for talent and economic growth. Yvette will bring the best out of our party and our country.    As a young man I spent several years as an aide to the great socialist Barbara Castle. She could have led Labour and transformed the country, but she was always opposed by conservative forces, including the tide of sexism still high in the country and in our party. I know we will not make the same mistake again, and will take the opportunity to elect our first woman as leader. Not only will Yvette provide contrast and insight, but she will be truly radical in the tradition Barbara established.    For half my life I have seen Labour, strong and united in government, trusted by the people to run our country. For the other half Labour has been divided, inward looking and unrealistic, while the country endured Tory governments. I'm voting for Yvette because I want her to be the next Prime Minister of our country. Please join me.

What had I learnt and loved in my time so far in the city of dreams that I could share with my family and give them the best possible experience. Because when you live in a place where you can both ski and surf on the same day the possibilities really are endless. Therefore for this week's blog I wanted to share with you my LA must do's and the things that maybe aren't worth the trek.         Where to Stay:    As my family were here two weeks I decided to split up the time with one week at the beach, and the second week in the madness of Hollywood. It's nice to see the different sides of the California - moutains, beach, city, etc however within the area you choose are even more options and decisions!! So here is what I picked and why...     Week 1 we stayed in; Manhattan Beach - A hidden gem for tourists. Because it's not at all touristy, which I personally like. Down in the South Bay you can really feel like a local, walk barefoot, surf, or hire a bike and go down the strand which is a consistent human traffic jam of runners, bikers, paddle skate boards, rollerblades, you name it! Everyone here is very active and its extremely motivating so make the most of that early morning jetlag and go for swim in the sea or attend a class at Yoga Loft where you can watch the sea waves as you vinyasa yourself happy.     For me it feels like a Devonshire surf town, you can walk around a paradise of local businesses and friendly people. It's the place to the experience the true chilled out side of California the kind you imagine you play singing The Beach Boys too and slow motion running Baywatch style. We booked into an 'air bnb' house that was situated right on the beach to make it a complete seaside Eden.     There are many other beach location options, which are more well known such as; Santa Monica and Venice Beach. For me, I prefer these as more day trip locations - Venice is full of colourful energy and people and the sights of Muscle Beach are something not to be missed! Walk along the boardwalk for a unique experience of hippie stalls and bodybuilder extraordinaires.  Santa Monica is a real tourist hub , with lots of shops, and the pier to play on - it's busy but if lots of people is your craic then it's for you. I would describe it as the most 'commercial' beach location, but there is a lot to see and do.  For the complete opposite experience you could to Malibu, where there really isn't much happening at all. Paradise cove offers lovely dining on the beach, but since most of the beach front properties are privately owned it - there aren't many options to enjoy the beach to it full potential unless you are visiting a friend's beach house or lucky enough to own one yourself!        For our second week in the city we checked into the famous Hollywood Roosevelt - the host of the first Oscars and former home to Marilyn Monroe. It located right on Hollywood boulevard so perfectly situated for all the tourist sights - We could see the Hollywood sign from our room and glare down on the famous names imprinted on the stars that lined the streets. The hotel however was host to a lot of crazy pool parties - So it's definitely suited for a more lively crowd and my parents I think would have preferred somewhere more mellow.        Other hotels I have visited in the past include The Beverly Whilshire, to me known as the Pretty Woman hotel - which is perfect for a romantic special stay amongst the glamour of Beverly Hills. I sent my parents there for the last night of the holiday as an early anniversary present. They were treated like absolute royalty - with complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries and an upgrade to a suite. I'm currently in the good books!    What to eat;    One the things I really encourage when visiting the US is to embrace the breakfast culture. Forget lunch, in LA it's all about going out for breakfast. One of my favourites is The Griddle in West Hollywood. The pancake portions are will certainly weigh more than you did at birth - So I recommend sharing! (It can be busy on weekends, so go weekdays if you have the option)   No trip to La is complete without the infamous 'In n out burger' where the 'off menu' items turn a simple burger and fries menu into an ectasy you never thought would fast food would be. Just ask for everthing 'animal style'. A timeless chain favourite where the menu resembles the size of a bible and the food is always awesome is The Cheesecake Factory. Please bear in mind all of the above is fat food for indulging  - But there is a time and place for everything in life!        For lighter options in Kalefornia its green go. Check out Café Grattitude or Gracias Madre for fantastic healthy vegan food that even a carnivore like myself can get along with. And for something special my favourite place is  Yamashiro , the Japanese gardens overlook the whole of Los Angeles for stunning views and outstanding food without the pretentious price tags.     What to do;    So once you know where your staying and accept you will probably gain five pounds you add a few activities to fuel the days.     It was my birthday during the visit, so a trip to Disneyland was my number one choice of celebration - Disney is an rather self explanatory amazing day! Other local theme parks include, Universal Studios - Which includes a studio tour of the sets of iconic movies and a highly recommended day out. For the more extreme riders Magic Mountain has the scariest rides I've ever experienced - If anyone reading this been on X2 then make sure you get in touch as I think we should set up some sort of survival society.     For the complete opposite kind of day head over to the Palisades, Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon and go hiking - It's a true California sport and timeless hardworking fun. If concerts are your thing there are constant perfomers coming into town - I took my parents to Taylor Swift's 1989 tour at the Staple Centre. It was probably one of our best nights.        So why skip across the pond now that summer is nearly over experience some 365 California sunshine - I could double this post in size with the amount of things there are to do! Hope everyone had a great August, and welcome to September - back to school, work, reality time but the good news is we can start getting excited about Christmas soon!    Don't forget to send me your LA experiences on my twitter or instagram!

The journalist-turned-presenter reportedly impressed producers when he covered for Ben Shephard earlier this year, though a second stint on the show was postponed at the last minute, after it emerged that Piers’ National Lottery adverts had broken broadcasting rules.       He confirmed the talks during a 'This Morning' interview    Now, Piers has revealed that he’s been having further meetings with the ‘GMB’ team, hinting that Susanna Reid could be getting a new, permanent co-worker.     Speaking on ‘This Morning’, Piers explained: "I like ‘Good Morning Britain’. I had a great time doing it and I may as well tell the truth about it.     “We've been talking about me having a more permanent slot there, which I would really enjoy because it was really good fun.”    He also went on to discuss the Lottery ad saga, stating: "I did a big advert for the National Lottery, but there's a bit of a clash if you do a commercial and you're doing a news current affairs show, as ‘Good Morning Britain’ is classified.    “We're trying to work through it and if we do then you'll be waking up to me in the morning."      Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on 'Good Morning Britain'    While producers were apparently delighted with Piers’ presenting back in April, TV fans weren’t so easy to please and a number of Twitter users took to the social networking site to slam the presenter.     He was also at the centre of an investigation by Ofcom, after laughing at a swearing guest on the show.    While Ofcom decided not to take the matter any further, they did note that Piers’ response was not appropriate.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:28:18	Don Letts: I Didn't Feel Accepted as Black and British Until Soul II Soul Came Through	Don Letts, culture clash master, a pioneer who coined the culture clash term by introducing reggae to the punk movement from his shop on King's Road Chelsea in the 70s​ at a time where British music and society was divided​. ​A film producer and documentary maker - a man of many talents who has contributed heavily to change the face of British music, art and fashion.     During a recent interview on my BBC Three Counties Radio show Letts reminisced on meeting Bob Marley. He struggled with the idea of being Black and British "The whole Black and British thing was happening in the mid 70s - back then it was a confusing concept. We didn't really know exactly where we fit. It was a weird social experiment that had no previous blueprint". Being Black and British may have existed on paper but in reality it was a myth due to peer pressure, influences mainly by American fashion, art, music and other trends. Letts concurred "We were looking to America but weren't American - we are of Jamaica but we weren't Jamaican". It was understandable for Letts to have been confused and question the whole of idea of being Black and British at a time where Britain was institutionally racist; the economy was on it's knees with a three day working week along with the rise of far right groups.     ​Letts highlighted the turning point of being British, Black and accepted "It wasn't till the advent of Soul II Soul that being Black and British actually meant something". But did it really take that long for society to finally accept British Black culture?  "It wasn't about recognition, it was about us feel happy about who we were. We had to feel comfortable within ourselves." Notting Hill Carnival, pirate radio movement, Scarman report on Brixton and not forgetting the explosion of rave culture which more or less brought all races and cultures together - those key significant moments have made Black Britons feel truly accepted for their contribution to society. Surely those key moments enabled Black Britons to be accepted for being part of that golden era and radical movement. Let's not forget Loose Ends, Aswad and the reggae soundsystems who flew the flag not just for British Black Music but for future generations to be seen, heard and not ignored. They should be credited for helping to make a change.    Letts may not be alone in his deep routed thoughts. It wasn't a case of fighting over African or West Indian roots but being acknowledged for being Black, British and proud. There may be other leading Black Britons who felt their presence was not welcomed and oppressed by a institutionalised and racist society. But Letts has a point in terms of role models and representation. Other than Trevor McDonald, Darcus Howe, Sir Trevor Phillips and Lenny Henry - spotting an ethnic or diverse person on television was a rarity. They were the only examples on mainstream television. At that time whilst growing up it didn't seem there was a problem or issue. It was an issue and wasn't challenged. There were hardly any BAME broadcasters or personalities. The main anchors were middle class and white and didn't seem to connect with Black British culture. There were no sufficient platforms available. It was also a struggle for many BAME parents. They were victim to the institutionalised mindset as 'over qualified immigrants'. Many with degrees in medicine, finance and other fields. Many were unable to get work of their preferred choice. Instead opting for early morning cleaning jobs, work as bus and train drivers and menial positions in order to fend for their families. But they worked hard and brought their children up to aspire and become something in their lives.     Letts involvement along with Soul II Soul, Goldie, Kanya King, Dizzee Rascal and Jamal Edwards has had a significant impact to highlight change and the perception of what being Black and British is all about. Cultural trends may challenge that but as Letts rightly points out "We are not American, we are not Jamaican - we are this new hybrid - Black and British." It's certainly not a trendy art form but here to stay and that should be respected.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:29:29	What Supplements Am I Taking at the Moment?	All anyone seems to care about when it comes to nutrition are supplements. The question I keep getting asked the most is what supplements I am using!     It's frustrating to say the least. It appears most young players, as well as many adults including other trainers, have things completely arse over elbow.     Supplements are not the cornerstone of anything. Never will be and certainly should never ever be considered as such. They play a part, but it's as a finishing touch. As a boost or to deal with a deficiency.    I answer all the questions we get tweeted across all our @JameshaskellHF social media channels personally. Not a week goes by when I don't get asked what supplements I take.     Nobody tweets asking about what amounts of food I eat? Or what changes they should make to their diet to get the results they want? Instead it's always "I want to get bigger, so what protein shake should I take?"    The reason I feel confident to speak freely about this is that I have been there and made this self same mistake.     I wanted short-term gain, but had no knowledge of nutrition. So I decided to look at taking protein shakes and creatine instead of focusing on my diet. I started training when I was 15, as a result of missing-out, literally at the very last hurdle in getting into the England u16 Rugby Union side.     I was lifting three times a week, doing speed and fitness work as well. I would eat the regular three school meals a day plus my trainer would bring me a couple of Tesco's Chickens to eat after training. I did try and eat more at meal times, but the "helpful" kitchen staff would only give me what everyone else had. I knew I had to eat more, but had no idea of what and how much. So I turned to using simple protein shakes and then later I added creatine.    Let's immediately address some of the underlying concerns and myths which exist about creatine for all the young school boys out there and their parents. Creatine is not a steroid. It won't make you massive; it probably won't put any size on you really. Finally, your internal organs will not melt, as was suggested to me when I was at school.     It's been so demonized, it's a joke. It DOES NOT build muscle. What it does is provide your muscles with the capacity to derive more energy in short bursts. This will allow you to work out at a higher intensity for longer, giving you the potential to stimulate more protein synthesis.    Because I took the wrong path with the emphasis on supplements NOT diet, I didn't for a long time get the results I wanted. This from what I now read is the same frustration which a considerable body of people out there appears to share.     Diet and whole food is what will make the difference. You need to train and you need to train hard. However, you need to get your diet right as well. Then over time you will definitely get the results you want. If you don't focus on diet you will just meet frustration and disappointment!        As a consequence of working with so many amazing nutritionists over the last few years, I have completely changed my outlook on supplements and diet. Of course I still use supplements now. Indeed I have developed my own product range, as I couldn't find what I wanted in the market and needed to be certain what I took was only the best formulation. I needed the products to be completely natural with no harmful additives; the ingredients only being of the highest quality, with the end product fully Informed Sport tested and guaranteed safe for all to take as a result of rigorous and stringent batch testing. If you want to find out more, please check out www.jameshaskell.com.     This article is not about my diet, as I have already covered off aspects of this in other blogs although it is a subject which I plan to return too shortly.     No, this blog is about the question of supplements. Following all the questions I keep getting posed, I decided I needed to publically answer the individual supplement questions I am asked once and for all, in order to be able to give all my followers the answers they so clearly want.     However there is only so much one can say in a blog. So if you want to know more on this subject then I go into a considerably more detail, in my new "Introduction to Rugby Fitness" guide which is launching very soon.     Follow our social media channels to find out more to ensure you are amongst the first to take a step in the right direction, by downloading and reading it.    The idea of this blog is to highlight the importance of diet as well as setting the context and balance between diet and the use of strategic supplements, in addition to providing you with a quick over-view of some of the supplements I actually do use.    My nutrition team at the moment is made up of Glenn Matten and Aiden Goggins, two leading experts in their field. (If you want to find out more about them, visit either www.glenmatten.com or www.aidangoggins.com). Both of them are at the very highest level in their chosen field, with a huge wealth of knowledge, expertise and experience.    These guys completely over-hauled and dissected what I did from a nutrition point of view. Based on a battery of blood and various other tests, they created for me the most bespoke and detailed nutrition programme possible.     It is big year of rugby after all, with that small matter of a World Cup in our own back yard. So I didn't want to leave any stone unturned in my dogged pursuit of becoming a better and more dynamic player.    As Sir Dave Brailsford, the ex Performance Director of British elite cycling said, it's all about a series of small marginal gains across a wide number of areas, which when all added together equate to one big gain, which delivers success     As part of the package created for me by Aidan and Glen there are four supplements I use every day. I have set out the products, the reason why I take them, as well as the source I recommend you get them through. Although they will be available from different sources. However please make sure you carefully check out the ingredients to ensure you are buying like-for-like.    All the supplements I suggest are from reputable companies and critically are all fully Informed Sport tested and certified.    Fish oils - Healthspan Elite - www.healthspan.co.uk/elite        One area that a lot of people, myself included, are found to be deficient in, once tested, are EPA. This is a key fatty acid that your body needs to help promote repair, recovery and health. Omega 3 supplements, i.e. fish oils have historically focused on providing a balanced level of these beneficial fatty acids, but increasingly experts in sports nutrition are suggesting that obtaining higher levels of EPA could be of greater importance. This is particularly true for high performance sports professionals and active individuals who are looking to aid recovery after intense periods of activity.    Probiotics - Healthspan Elite - www.healthspan.co.uk/elite        An area that is always neglected when looking at nutritional gains is the health of your gut. If you don't have a healthy digestive system this can affect your immune system, performance and how you absorb nutrients from food. Young players this wont be such an issue, but those older players who haven't eaten well or have put there body under stress could look at trying a high end probiotic to help fix and repair your gut. This is also the case for those who are looking to loose weight, and are perhaps new to training. Years of abusing your body in one shape or another can leave your digestive health, in pretty shoddy order. Probiotics will help get your gut back on track, and hopefully get things working, as they should.    Carnitne - Etixx - www.etixxsports.com/en/products/carnitine-1000        Carnitine has a key role in the nutritional health of the energy powerhouses of our cells, called the mitochondria. It facilitates the transfer of fats to the mitochondria to be used as fuel and thus works as a fat burning agent while increasing our energy levels. It also has brain-boosting effects, which increase alertness.     However Carnitine only works in physiological doses, there is only benefit from supplementation if you have low starting levels. Animal products like meat, dairy etc. are good sources. So high protein eaters generally have no need to supplement. However, there are always exceptions and higher demands, such as in your case, where blood tests showed you had low levels.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:31:51	Refugees In Britain Are More Likely To End Up In Labour Areas Than Conservative Ones, Figures Reveal	Conservative-dominated areas of England take in fewer refugees than Labour-strong regions, the Huffington Post UK can reveal.     Home Office figures obtained by this website show the North West has taken the most asylum seekers in every quarter since the beginning of 2008, and in the first three months of this year took nearly a third off all those dispersed around England.     Of the 41 councils in the North West, Labour runs 26, while just six are governed by the Tories.    The South East of England – the most Conservative area of the country in terms of seats and votes – took in just 2% of asylum seekers in the first three months of the year.    Of the 73 county, unitary and district councils in the South East, 50 are Tory run, while just seven are Labour-run.     The East of England – another Tory stronghold where 31 of the 52 councils are Conservative run – housed just 2.2% of refugees in Britain over the same period.     Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk told The Huffington Post UK: “The North West is carrying too much of the asylum seeker burden. Other regions, other towns and cities need to pull their weigh in terms of taking asylum seekers.     “The Government’s dispersal strategy is skewed towards the North West and places like Rochdale, where there are over 1,000 asylum seekers.    Simon Danczuk said the burden on the North West was too great and others had to 'pull their weight'     “This is unsustainable, particularly with the cuts the Conservative Government have made to local agencies.”     The Government began operating a policy of dispersal in the early 2000s, after concerns were raised asylum seekers were being concentrated in London and the South East.     While North West cities and towns such as Liverpool and Rochdale are particularly popular areas, the South East and South West have taken in the lowest share of asylum seekers over the last ten years of any region.

In February this year the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson attacked Serco for sending too many asylum seekers to the city, and warned of “community cohesion” problems.     Mr Anderson said: “There seems to be a sort of asylum apartheid operating where certain cities are the ones taking the unfair share.”     Liverpool City Council claimed the Home Office approved ration of one accommodated asylum seeker per 200 local residents was being exceeded in at least six wards in the city – in some cases by as much as 300 per cent.     In the first quarter of 2015, 24,948 asylum seekers were in dispersal accommodation around England. Here is the full breakdown:     North West – 7,450 (29.9%)  West Midlands – 4,406 (17.7%)  Yorkshire and The Humber – 3,571 (14.3%)  Greater London – 2,748 (11%)  North East – 2,717 (10.9%)  East Midlands – 2,232 (8.9%)  South West – 775 (3.1%)  East of England – 556 (2.2%)  South East – 493 (2%)     Rest of the UK  Wales – 2,626  Scotland – 492  Northern Ireland – 172     Research by The Huffington Post UK also shows refugees have more chance of being granted asylum in the UK than the majority of other EU countries, including Germany, France and Sweden.     The UK first instance rejection rate for asylum applications was 61% in 2014, marginally above the EU average of 55 per cent.  Of the 25,870 applications, 10,050 were rejected.      However, the UK issued final rejection notices to 8,735 of 12,750 asylum seeker appeal reviews in the same year – a rate of 68.5%, well below the EU average of 82.4%.     Germany also had an initial rejection rate above the EU average (58%) and rejected 37,340 of 44,335 asylum seeker appeals - 84.2%. Croatia had a final rejection rate of 100%.     The only countries to have a lower final rejection rate than the UK were Cyprus, Ireland, Netherlands and Finland.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:32:28	BBC2 Special Forces Ultimate Hell Week: Inside Story	Gasping for air, my body is convulsing with cold, I strain my muscles to work - to warm me but more importantly to keep me out of the eye of the Navy Seals who are looking to single people out for extra punishment.                              *****    The green hills of Southern Wales rolled by outside my window unnoticed. My hands we're clasped in my lap, my fingers danced slowly as if to a melancholic bolero. A nervous chatter filled the bus but I didn't hear the words.     My phone started vibrating and another text popped up wishing me luck and telling me to stay happy. Without even a smile I put the phone back in my pocket - I felt anything but happy.    Beside me were 29 of the fittest and toughest men and women the UK had to offer. Our destination 'BBC 2 Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week'. 6 Special Forces from around the world were being brought in to see if they could break the people who sat beside me on the coach, myself included.  The Israeli Yamam, the Russian Spetsnaz and of course the British SAS were the names the rumours focused on during the lead up.    We'd been told to prepare ourselves for sleep depravation, starvation, and interrogation. Brutal work outs, and torture had also been promised. I knew it was going to be tough. Probably the toughest thing I'd ever done.    I've completed Ironman triathlons, raced in my countries team kit, cycled 9,000 miles from London to India, broken world records, taken part in European CrossFit competitions amongst other crazy sporting challenges. I'd survived falling 10m off a cliff face, I'd endured a 50mph bicycle accident, and suffered sickness in India like no other. How much tougher could this be?    The short answer? A lot tougher.    What I was about to take part in would leave me with wounds all over my body, numb toes, 10kg less muscle, and night terrors that woke me tangled within my own sheets endlessly...     The first Special Forces that welcomed us were the US Navy Seals. When I say 'welcome' I use the word it in the loosest possible terms. We were told to get in a press-up position and then the most brutal PT session ensued, whilst being put under as much mental strain as our hosts could harness.    Falling into bed that night it felt like my body was broken beyond repair. I was absolutely considering quitting right there and then. I felt like I was the only one who was suffering. I fell into a sleep that felt like it might never end.    Again, I was wrong.     Boom! A grenade goes off. Smoke bombs fill the air. Machine gun fire rings in your ears. At 1am we were woken by the Navy Seals for what literally felt like hell. I don't remember it at all - my body and mind were crushed by the demands of the workout. I do remember a camera being shoved in my face, my first moment in the public eye, and a question coming from the darkness 'How are you doing Danny?' This was my chance to make a good impression, to make my mark, to show everyone what a 'tough guy' I was. My response... "I'm feeling a little emotional," as I physically force back the tears. Perfect.    Life didn't get any easier after this but from somewhere deep within me my happiness returned and that happiness was, I believe, the strongest weapon in my armoury when facing the other Special Forces.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 12:54:38	Europe Is Facing a Clear and Undeniable Refugee Crisis	Europe faces a refugee crisis. A humanitarian crisis of desperate people with no choice but to flee war, political repression and state breakdown and it is now clear and undeniable.     As European Green Reinhard Butikofer reported from the Macedonian-Serbian border, the majority are from Syria, but they're also from Iraq and Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan. At other sites Eritreans, fleeing a repressive, rights-abusing regime, are also present in significant numbers.     These are people who are clearly, under the 1951 Refugee Convention, drawn up in response to the European crisis of World War II, in need of, and entitled to, refuge.     What's also becoming clearer, is that responses are polarising at two extremes.    On the humanitarian side, there's inspiring, exciting leadership, not mostly from governments or even charitable bodies, but individuals, people getting together and saying that they're not going to tolerate desperation, suffering and want, but are going to take individual action to provide refuge.     The people of Iceland deserve particular credit, 10,000 of their 300,000 total numbers stepping forward to say they'd personally provide a home for refugees - putting to total, overwhelming, shame their government, which had initially said it could provide refuge for a paltry 50.     There's what's known as, in terms that would have seemed strange indeed in the 1940s, an 'Airbnb' for refugees, Refugees Welcome, based in Berlin.       And in Britain, there's fragmented but passionate efforts scattered around the country, communities organising to say "we'll host refugees". I'm proud that in many places, from Brighton and Hove to Stroud, Camden to St Albans and in many other places; local Green parties and our councillors have been at the forefront of pushes to host Syrian refugees.     Many ordinary people across Europe are drawing on their family's experiences over generations - for exile and flight from war and conflict has been the fate of many Europeans for many recent centuries - and saying: "we will not abandon these refugees".     Green MEP Molly Scott Cato's article for the New Statesman last week draws parallels between the fate of today's refugees and the Jews denied sanctuary, or forced to hunt desperately for it, before the start of the World War II, has received considerable attention, understandably. The parallel is immensely powerful - and apt.     German Chancellor Angela Merkel isn't an unproblematic figure in humanitarian contexts (the case of the Palestinian girl Reemcomes to mind), but she deserves credit for declaring that all Syrians who make it to Germany will automatically be given refugee status. The message has already got through, with packed trains of refugees heading for Germany.     It's said some refugees are calling her 'Mama Merkel'. There's no chance, however, on current evidence, of any refugee talking about Mama May, or Papa Cameron.    For sadly, if predictably, the British government falls into the other pole of reaction to the crisis, with those who'd deny the reality of the need for refuge, who pull up the drawbridge of a peaceful, prosperous country and turn their back on desperation, fear and need, leaving the children to drown.     David Cameron, as he did in response to a direct challenge from me in the Leaders' Debates on his failure to join the UN programme to rehouse the most vulnerable Syrian refugees, has fallen back on the defence that we've provided significant funding to states neighbouring Syria to help deal with the refugee crisis. That's true, and commendable, but it clear isn't enough. Not providing a new home for those who need it is shirking our responsibilities.     So what should we do now?     First, we have to acknowledge that this is a crisis that needs a European - indeed eventually a global - response. We're in a situation like that in the 1970s, with the refugees from IndoChina, for whom the world found 2.5million new homes. It happened imperfectly, slowly, not entirely adequately, but it happened. The grandchildren of those refugees are now established, secure, valued members of societies around the globe.     In Britain, we should abandon the fiction of our own utterly risible "vulnerable Syrians" programme (at last count helping 216 refugees) and sign up to the UN scheme to take our fair share of the most vulnerable.     And in terms of a Europe-wide response, we should not be the foot-draggers, not be the resistors, but instead join Merkel's leadership in demanding a programme to ensure that those refugees who reach European soil are fairly distributed among European states - with Britain taking its reasonable share considering both our population and relative wealth.     That programme should be particularly focused on those with family and community ties already here, and the language skills that make them want to come to the UK. That's what would end the crisis and disruption at Calais.     More, we need to work with European states and the countries, particularly those neighbouring Syria, who have borne the great brunt of the refugee responsibility to set up an orderly resettlement programme that doesn't force refugees into the arms of smugglers and criminals to reach European shores. We can't take all of them, but we can take a significant number, which will help take the pressure off states like Lebanon, where one in four inhabitants is now a Syrian refugee.     And really, Cameron and allies, let's stop talking about tackling the smugglers and criminals as if they're a cause of the problem. They're not, they're a response to it - a response that's produced a many-headed Hydra. Even if you cut off one smuggling gang, there'll be another poor fisherman with a rotting hulk, another 'man with a van' ready to take their place.     We can't guarantee that we won't see yet one more tragic, pathetic figure of the dragging body of a drowned child in the arms of another tormented rescuer, but an orderly resettlement programme, combined with a safe, organised redistribution of refugees across the continent, would certainly drastically reduce the number of such photos and the number of hideous, almost unimaginable deaths like those of the refugees suffocated in a container lorry in Austria.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 13:49:21	Peter Tatchell LGBT Rights Activist Warns Of Jeremy Corbyn's ‘Unsavoury' Friends	Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of having 'unsavoury' friends by high profile LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, but that hasn't stopped the former Labour candidate backing the left-winger in the party's leadership race.     Tatchell's claims add to the increasing scrutiny into Corbyn's 'political friendships', including dealings with characters from his past who have made 'homophobic' remarks.    Such relationships have seen Corbyn share a platform with activist Dyab Abou Jahjah and preacher Ibrahim Hewitt, both of whom hold views against homosexuality.       Jeremy Corbyn has been endorsed by human rights activist Peter Tatchell      Fellow Labour leadership candidate Yvette Cooper also probed the Islington North MP's 'friends'.     "There are some people who I think have quite extreme views, homophobic and pushing homophobic abuse and pushing extremist abuse that I don’t think he should give legitimacy to by inviting to public meetings" she said.     Cooper's remarks were made - in part - reacting to Corbyn's relationship with activist Dyab Abou Jahjah.    In 2009 Corbyn invited him to speak at a Parliamentary debate, despite his previous writing which stated: “Aids-spreading faggots” are “everything Europe holds holy”.    The radical activist also lamented that Muslims were “persecuted” for being “disgusted” by homosexuality, describing it as a “sickness”.    Corbyn hit back at these remarks, stating: “My staff have researched this and it appears I did meet this man… I meet a lot people on all sides in the Middle East and it does not mean I agree with their views.”    Although when Abou Jahjah spoke to LBC in August, he claimed they had met several times previously: “We had, I think, two times lunch or breakfast together so I cannot say that Mr Corbyn is a personal friend, but he is absolutely a political friend" he said.     SEE ALSO:    Jeremy Corbyn's Economics Are 'PFI On Steroids', Claims Yvette Cooper  People Are Suggesting Ways For The Media To Smear Jeremy Corbyn    In addition, Corbyn, who has historically supported LGBT equality in Parliament, has previously praised preacher Ibrahim Hewitt, stating he was as a 'close friend.'    Hewitt is the author of controversial book ‘What Does Islam Say?’ – which compares homosexuals to paedophilia and incest.      Video of Corbyn stating he is a 'close friend' of Hewitt    Speaking at a meeting for the Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, Interpal, Corbyn said: “I’ve got to know Ibrahim Hewitt extremely well, and I consider him to be a very good friend."    Hewitt’s book condemns gay people, stating: “If people have such desires, they should keep them to themselves, and control their desires to avoid forbidden practices."    Corbyn hit back again and said: “I have met people in the context of discussions about the Middle East with whom I profoundly disagree. I have met representatives of the Iranian government with whom I profoundly disagree with on the human rights issues.”      LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell has backed Corbyn for Labour leader    Tatchell, despite backing the Green party before the general election, has now favoured the Islington North MP for leadership.    In a piece written for the International Business Times, Tatchell referred to such relationships, but not specifically to dealings with 'homophobes': "At what point do links with bad people put a politician beyond the pale?     "How many flawed judgements does it take to cancel out all the good that a MP might have done and espoused?    "He does need to explain in more detail why he has attended and spoken at meetings alongside some pretty unsavoury bigots who advocate human rights abuses – and especially why he did so without publicly criticising their totalitarian politics.”    Tatchell wrote on Twitter this afternoon that he stood by his support for Corbyn, despite those raising questions over Corbyn's platform policy.     @ReachEd Still Green and Left.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 14:24:29	Refugee Crisis: David Cameron Bows To Pressure To Take 'Thousands' More Fleeing Conflict	David Cameron is poised to announce Britain will accept thousands more refugees from Syria, reports suggest after the Prime Minister revealed he was "deeply moved" by pictures of a drowned refugee boy and facing huge pressure to respond.    The Guardian has reported details of a specific plan to take displaced people from UN refugee agency camps on the border of Syria, but officials are thrashing out a plan over where they will be placed and how it is funded.    But the move is unlikely to pave the way for tens of thousands of new arrivals akin to Germany and is likely to take the form of an expansion of an existing scheme.    The Prime Minister fell short of spelling out these plans when pressed by media on a regional UK tour today.    But there appeared to be a shift in tone to reflect the public mood of widespread despair over the death of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, found dead on a beach in Turkey after trying to escape Syria.       Aylan Kurdi (left) and his brother Galip (right), who perished    Pressure to start to take the numbers already being taken elsewhere in Europe came from the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who accused him of adopting a “walk on by on the other side” approach after he said on Wednesday that the UK would not take any extra refugees.    Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, Lady Warsi, the former party chairman, have all spoken out, as have several backbench MPs.    Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman urged Cameron to convene an emergency meeting of Cobra cabinet committee to coordinate the government response and Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said it was "utterly shameful ... that our prime minister is just turning his back”.    UPDATE:   His Name Was Aylan Kurdi   Heartbreaking Cartoons Capture World's Sadness Over Drowned Syrian Boy      Since the start of the crisis, the UK has granted asylum to around 5,000 Syrians, significantly higher than 216 migrants critics have highlighted, which arrived through a specific relocation programme that resettles Syrians placed in camps.      But the Prime Minister said today: “Anyone who saw those pictures overnight could not help but be moved and, as a father, I felt deeply moved by the sight of that young boy on a beach in Turkey.    "Britain is a moral nation and we will fulfil our moral responsibilities.    “We are taking thousands of people, and we will take thousands of people.”    But he is also conscious of being seen to open the borders and encourage more people fleeing the Middle East to make the treacherous journey to the UK.     “We need a comprehensive solution, a new government in Libya, we need to deal with the problems in Syria," he added.     “I would say the people responsible for these terrible scenes we see, the people most responsible, are President Assad in Syria and the butchers of Isil [Islamic State] and the criminal gangs that are running this terrible trade in people.    "And we have to be as tough on them at the same time.”    SEE ALSO:    Aylan Kurdi Named As The Drowned Syrian Boy Who Washed Up On Turkish Beach    Petition Reaches 100,000 Signatures Needed To Trigger Debate In Parliament    Heartbreaking Cartoons Capture World's Sadness Over Drowned Syrian Boy    Tory MP Mocks Woman's 'Pathetic' And 'Trendy Left Wing View' Over Refugee Crisis    Fresh Attacks On Katie Hopkins' Migrants Column As Refugee Toddler Washes Ashore    Drowned Syrian Toddler Prompts Graphic And Bold Front Pages    David Miliband Lauds Germany's Response To The Syrian Crisis     	UK Politics - The Huffington Post	Graeme Demianyk	http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/03/refugee-syria-david-cameron-crisis-aylan-kurdi_n_8084540.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 17:04:17	Jeremy Corbyn Declared Winner Of Final Labour Leadership Debate In Gateshead	Jeremy Corbyn was declared the winner of the final Labour leadership debate by a huge margin tonight, despite being accused of offering “false promises” by Yvette Cooper.     The Islington North MP lapped up applause from an audience of Labour voters in Gateshead as he set out his vision for the country.    An online poll for Sky News, who broadcast the debate, deemed that Mr Corbyn won the clash – with 80.7 percent of viewers using Sky Pulse giving him the victory.      Labour's Jeremy Corbyn arrives to take part in a Labour party leadership final debate, at the Sage in Gateshead, England, Thursday, Sept. 3, 2015    Mr Corbyn won applause from the 200 or so audience members with a string of left wing statements, including a rejection of further public sector cuts, attacking the free market nature of the European Union and opposing further bombing campaigns against ISIL.     The final moments of the debate saw Ms Cooper and Mr Corbyn square off over the veteran MP’s plan to fund infrastructure investment by printing more money – dubbed People’s Quantitative Easing.     The Shadow Home Secretary said: "You're offering people false promises. Quantitative easing has stopped because the economy is now growing. If you simply keep printing money when an economy is growing it simply increases inflation.    "You're offering people false promise. It sounds brilliant - everyone claps because everyone wants to the see the schools and hospitals done. It's dishonest, it's false promise, we've got to offer people real hope. You're not being straight with people."     Mr Corbyn dismissed the claims, and said leading economists supported his plans and a similar policy had helped boost the Japanese economy.     Liz Kendall repeatedly claimed Labour needed to prove its economic credibility to millions of voters who backed the Tories in May’s General Election. She received the least amount of applause in the hall.      Jeremy Corbyn, Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall, and Andy Burnham, pose for the media at the end of the Labour party leadership final debate at the Sage in Gateshead, England, Thursday, Sept. 3, 2015    Andy Burnham’s best moment came when he appealed for the party to come together after the leadership election, and defended the achievements of past leader Tony Blair.    He said: "To direct all this anger at man who won three General Elections and say he doesn't have a right to speak out... is ridiculous. This party could go into a period of infighting coming out of this leadership election. If Labour does that, we will let down millions of people out there."    Labour members have until September 10 to cast their ballots, with the winner revealed at a special London conference on September 12.

MORE 'STRICTLY':  Revealed! All The Celeb Victims Of The 'Strictly' Curse  The Show's Most Memorable, Awkward Moments  The Sexiest Ever 'Strictly' Stars    The Olympic boxer surprised reporters at this year’s ‘Strictly’ press launch when he arrived with his arm in a sling, having undergone surgery for an injury he acquired in the boxing ring earlier this year.    Assuring everyone his injury should have healed by the first week of live shows, Anthony admitted to HuffPost UK and others: “It’s hard, but as an athlete you’ve got to work around stuff.      Anthony Ogogo    “My plan was, as a boxer, I was going to fight eight times this year. But I dislocated my shoulder, and couldn’t fight.”    He went on to explain that when ‘Strictly’ learned of his predicament, they allowed him to make the most of a bad situation, and offered him a spot on the show.    Anthony continued: “‘Strictly’ got wind of it, and they were keen on me anyway, so they rang me up and said ‘do you want to do the show?’       Anthony in the ring    “I spoke to my surgeon, spoke to a doctor and my physio, and they said as long as you’re careful, for the six to eight weeks post-op, you’ll be OK.     “So I had a choice to make. Do I want to sit at home and do nothing. Sulk, whinge, watch TV and eat crap and get fat? Or do I want to do the biggest TV show in the country, raise my profile, get to wear the sexiest, campest outfits in the world…?     “And really, the camp outfits, that was the tipping point! That’s what sold it to me.”    ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ returns to our screens this Saturday (5 September), when the celebrity contestants will also be finding out which professional dancers they’ve been partnered with.

MORE 'STRICTLY':  Revealed! All The Celeb Victims Of The 'Strictly' Curse  The Show's Most Memorable, Awkward Moments  The Sexiest Ever 'Strictly' Stars    After much speculation, the weather presenter confirmed last month that she would be heading onto the ‘Strictly’ dance floor when the new series returns to our screens.    But having now begun her training, Carol has confessed that viewers shouldn’t expect too much from her dancing ability.      Carol 'What A Woman' Kirkwood    When asked at this year’s ‘Strictly’ launch if she’s worried about being the first celebrity contestant to leave the competition, she told HuffPost UK and other reporters: “Oh, I’ve resigned myself to that already. Because really I am a carthorse.     “You know how there’s usually a comedy figure? Well…    “And the other thing is, I have a real problem with my right and my left. So they can be telling me ‘left foot’ all they want - I still don’t know which one it is.”      Carol gets 'Strictly'-fied    Carol also claimed that ‘Strictly’ fans might get to see a different side to her than the cheery disposition that ‘BBC Breakfast’ viewers are used to.    She joked: “Tears! The gnashing of teeth! Yeah you probably will.    “You might see frustration when I don’t get the steps. I find that even now, I think, ‘why can I not just pick this up?’     “I’ve never danced - apart from at weddings and things, but I have no formal training. And so this dance muscle everyone keeps talking about… I don’t have any muscles, let alone a dance muscle. So I’m hoping that will develop and soon we can relax into it.”    ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ launches this Saturday (5 September), when it will also be revealed which professional dancers the celebrities have been partnered with this year.

MORE 'STRICTLY':  Revealed! All The Celeb Victims Of The 'Strictly' Curse  The Show's Most Memorable, Awkward Moments  The Sexiest Ever 'Strictly' Stars    The pair have played Mick and Linda Carter in the BBC soap for just almost two years, and it sounds like Danny’s character’s protective ways are beginning to spill over into real life.    Speaking to HuffPost UK and other reporters at this year’s ‘Strictly’ press launch, Kellie said: “He’s been a massive supporter to me, he’s one of my best friends, and he’ll be championing me.       Kellie Bright    “He’s also quite nervous for me, and I think he feels quite protective of me, like, ‘What if they say nasty things to you in the comments?’     “And I tell him, ‘It’s just like taking direction, they’re only there trying to make you better’. But he’s just like, ‘Oh I couldn’t cope with that’.”      Kellie and Danny behind the bar at the Queen Vic    When asked whether she felt pressure to follow in the footsteps of other ‘EastEnders’ stars who have gone on to great success on ‘Strictly’, such as Jake Wood last year, Kellie admitted: “I think that the pressure generally comes from yourself.     “And I do put pressure on myself, but that’s in anything I do, whether I’m baking a bloody cake or anything, do you know what I mean?     “So I don’t necessarily feel it from outside. I also just try and put the blinkers on in life really. I try not to take in what’s going on outside, and all the circus and everything going on around it. We just do what we can do, and enjoy it. I just want to have a nice time.”      Georgia May Foote    Kellie is also quick to downplay any rivalry between herself and fellow soap actress Georgia May Foote, who played Katy Armstrong in ‘Coronation Street’ up until earlier this year.    Addressing the alleged rivalry, she insisted: “Where are you hearing that from? That’s all media, we know it is. I just want to mother her really!”    Georgia added: “Because we’re from the same industry and we have the same background, it’s good because we can help each other! There’s no rivalry - if anything we help each other more.”    Meanwhile, Kellie later admitted that after a year of heavy storylines on 'EastEnders', it felt good to be doing something a little more light-hearted, with 'Strictly'.    She said: "It’s nice to do the flipside. It’s nice to do something that is going to be fun and it’s a completely different thing, isn’t it?     "But I’m doing the two together, don’t forget! So in my day job I’ll be crying... and by Saturday night I’ll be well! And glitzy!"    ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ returns to our screens this Saturday (1 September), when it will be revealed which contestants the professional dancers have been paired with this year.

Thu, 03 Sep 2015 19:05:16	'Strictly Come Dancing': Peter Andre And Helen George Named Ones To Watch From This Year's Line-Up	This year’s ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ contestants have named Peter Andre and Helen George among the ones to watch in this year’s contest.    MORE 'STRICTLY':  Revealed! All The Celeb Victims Of The 'Strictly' Curse  The Show's Most Memorable, Awkward Moments  The Sexiest Ever 'Strictly' Stars    Despite having only just started rehearsals for the new series of ‘Strictly’, which launches this weekend, the ‘Mysterious Girl’ singer has obviously stood out to a number of his competitors as a potential winner.    Speaking about Peter at this year’s ‘Strictly’ press launch, Jamelia told HuffPost UK and other reporters: “He is a fantastic dancer, I don’t know why he’s playing it down, I’ve been getting him mixed up with the professionals!       Peter Andre    “I won’t say anything, but just make sure you watch the launch show, and watch Peter.”    Olympic runner Iwan Thomas also said Peter is “very good” and Helen is “amazing”, also branding ‘Countryfile’ presenter Anita Rani a “dark horse”.      Anita Rani    Meanwhile, when Anita was asked who to look out for, she complimented Peter’s “snake hips”, as well as Georgia May Foote, who she called a “just a little bouncy bean of a beautiful being”.    Alrighty then.    Peter has admitted he’s less than comfortable being named the favourite, admitting: “That is the worst pressure anyone could have… you can’t stuff up once. That’s what’s scary.     “And that could all change once we actually start dancing, people will look and they’ll go that person’s good, that person’s alright.     “Even if you’re good at one style of dancing, you can’t have your thumbs up, you’ve got to have your chest out, you’ve got to have your shoulders back. It’s different for everyone.”      Helen George    He then named Jamelia and Helen George as two of his strongest competitors, telling the ‘Superstar’ singer: “Your hips! Not that I should be looking at your hips, I’m not! But [Jamelia] can move, I’m telling you.     “And Helen, we were saying that she stands like a dancer, and she’s good too.”      Jeremy Vine    Helen, on the other hand, had a very different pick for who she would name as her favourite, telling us: “I’m going to put a bet on Jeremy Vine. Am I allowed to bet?”    Probs not, Helen. Probs not.    ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ returns to our screens this Saturday (5 September), when the celebrity contestants will also be finding out which professional dancers they’ve been partnered with.

A whole host of popular faces have signed up for the series, including ‘The C Word’ star Paul Nicholls.       Paul starred opposite Sheridan Smith in the drama, which was screened earlier this year    Fresh from impressing in the emotional drama, Paul has jetted off to the French-Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, joining regular cast members Kris Marshall and Joséphine Jobert.     Paul is understandably delighted to have signed up for the show and states: “I’m very excited to have the opportunity to work with the fantastic cast and crew on the upcoming series of ‘Death In Paradise’.       Heida, Nigel and Emma have all signed up    Paul will be joined by former ‘Hollyoaks’ star Emma Rigby and Heida Reed, who starred in ‘Poldark’ along with Hannah Britland, who you might recognise from ‘Fresh Meat’, Julien Ovenden from ‘Downton Abbey’ and Nigel Lindsay.     While details of each star’s guest role are yet to be revealed, Paul has teased details of his character, saying: “I play a fashion photographer in my episode which is very different from many of my previous roles so was a great challenge.     “Filming in Guadeloupe was incredible too. We had so much fun!”      Kris Marshall will return as DI Humphrey Goodman    Neve McIntosh (‘Doctor Who’), Lloyd Owen , ‘Game of Thrones’ star Charlotte Hope and Lucy Cohu, who popped up in ‘Broadchurch’, will also be making appearances.     Since arriving on TV screens in 2011, ‘Death In Paradise’ has remained a huge hit with fans, and is now considered to be one of the BBC’s highest rated dramas. The new series will air in early 2016.      Filmed on the French-Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, the much-loved winter warmer has gone from strength to strength over the past four series, pulling inan average consolidated figure of almost 9 million viewers to cement its position as one of BBC One’s highest rating dramas.

MORE 'STRICTLY':  Revealed! All The Celeb Victims Of The 'Strictly' Curse  The Show's Most Memorable, Awkward Moments  The Sexiest Ever 'Strictly' Stars    Helen has said that she’s feeling anxious about the show because she’s not used to appearing on TV as herself, having become known to the public for her role as Trixie in the BBC period drama.    Speaking to HuffPost UK and other reporters at this year’s ‘Strictly’ press launch, she revealed: “I’m not so nervous about the dancing as such… well I am, obviously. Really nervous.       Helen George    "But the pro dancers are so good that I’m more nervous about all the camera stuff, because I’m not used to just being myself, and talking to the camera.    “I find it really intimidating. And also just saying things straight down the barrel, and all that stuff is so foreign to me. And not being in character - I’m getting sweaty palms just talking about it!”     She then joked: “I need to find a character to play on the dance floor and re-name myself… Shaniqua.”      Helen in character on 'Call The Midwife'    One thing Helen says she is excited for, though, are her ‘Strictly’ outfits, specifically “all the glitter”.    Addressing her costumes, she told us: “The dresses are incredible, and they’re things that if someone said to you in real life, ‘wear that’, you’d be like, ‘there’s no way’.     “But then you totally get in the mood, and they’re like ‘oh just have it a bit shorter, and have it a bit lower, and have some more glitter...’”    Despite her nerves about the show, Helen has been named among the early ones to watch by her celebrity competitors, alongside fellow contestant Peter Andre.    ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ returns to our screens on Saturday night (5 September), when it will be revealed who the celebrity contestants have been partnered with from this year’s professional dancers.
